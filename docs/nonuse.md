### For next time

Great! You've successfully set up a dataset class for the LibriTTS dataset and are able to load audio and text samples. The next steps in building your Text-to-Speech (TTS) model from scratch typically involve the following stages:

### 1. Data Preprocessing

Before training your model, you need to preprocess both the audio and text data.

#### Audio Preprocessing

- **Extract Mel-Spectrograms**: Use the function you provided earlier to convert audio waveforms into mel-spectrograms, which are commonly used as input features for TTS models.
- **Normalization**: Normalize the mel-spectrograms to ensure consistent input to the model.

#### Text Preprocessing

- **Tokenization**: Convert the text into a suitable format (e.g., phonemes, characters, or subword tokens). You can use libraries like `g2p` for phoneme conversion or implement a character-based tokenizer.
- **Mapping to IDs**: Create a mapping from tokens to unique IDs for model input.

### 2. Model Architecture

Design the architecture of your TTS model. Common architectures include:

- **Tacotron**: A sequence-to-sequence model that generates mel-spectrograms from text.
- **WaveNet**: A generative model that can produce raw audio waveforms from mel-spectrograms.
- **FastSpeech**: A non-autoregressive model that generates mel-spectrograms more efficiently.

You can start with a simpler architecture like Tacotron or FastSpeech.

### 3. Training Loop

Implement the training loop to train your model. This involves:

- **Loss Function**: Choose an appropriate loss function (e.g., Mean Squared Error for mel-spectrograms).
- **Optimizer**: Select an optimizer (e.g., Adam) and set learning rates.
- **Batch Processing**: Iterate through your DataLoader, extract features and labels, and feed them into your model.
- **Validation**: Set aside a validation set to monitor the model's performance during training.

### 4. Inference

Once your model is trained, implement an inference pipeline to convert text input into audio output. This typically involves:

- Generating mel-spectrograms from text using the trained model.
- Converting mel-spectrograms back to audio waveforms using a vocoder (e.g., WaveGlow, HiFi-GAN).

### 5. Evaluation

Evaluate the quality of the generated speech using metrics like:

- **Mean Opinion Score (MOS)**: Subjective evaluation by listeners.
- **Objective Metrics**: Such as Mel cepstral distortion (MCD).

### Example Code Snippet for Data Preprocessing

Hereâ€™s a brief example of how you might implement the audio preprocessing step:

```python
def preprocess_data(dataset):
    mel_spectrograms = []
    texts = []

    for waveform, sample_rate, text in dataset:
        if waveform is not None:
            # Extract mel-spectrogram
            mel_spec, _ = extract_mel_spectrogram(waveform.numpy(), sample_rate)
            mel_spectrograms.append(mel_spec)
            texts.append(text)

    return mel_spectrograms, texts

mel_spectrograms, texts = preprocess_data(dataset)
```

### Next Steps

1. Implement the preprocessing functions for both audio and text.
2. Design your model architecture.
3. Set up the training loop and start training your model.
