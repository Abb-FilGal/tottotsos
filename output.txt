Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 132000]), Text sample: In fact, he had looked at twenty very much as he looked at sixty, lacking a little of the grayness.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35040]), Text sample: "It's a boy I've come for.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51360]), Text sample: Maybe they were out of boys of the brand you wanted."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 230880]), Text sample: Her face was small, white and thin, also much freckled; her mouth was large and so were her eyes, which looked green in some lights and moods and gray in others.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 127920]), Text sample: "I suppose you are mr matthew Cuthbert of Green Gables?" she said in a peculiarly clear, sweet voice.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56880]), Text sample: They were good, you know-the asylum people.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147840]), Text sample: With this Matthew's companion stopped talking, partly because she was out of breath and partly because they had reached the buggy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 141841]), Text sample: And I've never had a pretty dress in my life that I can remember-but of course it's all the more to look forward to, isn't it?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 59281]), Text sample: And then I can imagine that I'm dressed gorgeously.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 97920]), Text sample: When we got on the train I felt as if everybody must be looking at me and pitying me.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48238]), Text sample: I wasn't a bit sick coming over in the boat.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56882]), Text sample: She said she never saw the beat of me for prowling about.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47759]), Text sample: She said I must have asked her a thousand already.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39118]), Text sample: And what DOES make the roads red?"

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52560]), Text sample: "Well, that is one of the things to find out sometime.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89281]), Text sample: It just makes me feel glad to be alive-it's such an interesting world.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 28798]), Text sample: But am I talking too much?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33359]), Text sample: Would you rather I didn't talk?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 70800]), Text sample: I can STOP when I make up my mind to it, although it's difficult."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 88801]), Text sample: Women were bad enough in all conscience, but little girls were worse.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 21601]), Text sample: I don't mind."

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 142560]), Text sample: I can't feel exactly perfectly happy because-well, what color would you call this?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 61680]), Text sample: "Now you see why I can't be perfectly happy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23762]), Text sample: I never could find out.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20160]), Text sample: Can you tell me?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99600]), Text sample: "Well now, I'm afraid I can't," said matthew, who was getting a little dizzy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82560]), Text sample: "Well, whatever it was it must have been something nice because she was divinely beautiful.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67440]), Text sample: Have you ever imagined what it must feel like to be divinely beautiful?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 131040]), Text sample: Which would you rather be if you had the choice-divinely beautiful or dazzlingly clever or angelically good?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48959]), Text sample: It's certain I'll never be angelically good.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68640]), Text sample: mrs Spencer says-oh, mr Cuthbert!

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99841]), Text sample: They had simply rounded a curve in the road and found themselves in the "Avenue."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57840]), Text sample: Did you ever have an ache like that, mr Cuthbert?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90000]), Text sample: "Well now, I just can't recollect that I ever had."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 198241]), Text sample: Other people may call that place the Avenue, but I shall always call it the White Way of Delight. Have we really only another mile to go before we get home?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90721]), Text sample: Something still pleasanter may come after, but you can never be sure.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35760]), Text sample: But I'm glad to think of getting home.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51601]), Text sample: "That's Barry's pond," said matthew.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49681]), Text sample: But why do other people call it Barry's pond?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46799]), Text sample: Orchard Slope's the name of his place.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 26159]), Text sample: So I shut my eyes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 100081]), Text sample: Because, you see, if the bridge DID crumple up I'd want to SEE it crumple.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 40321]), Text sample: I always like the rumble part of it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24961]), Text sample: Now I'll look back.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 27841]), Text sample: I'm sure I'll guess right."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57601]), Text sample: "That's it, isn't it?" she said, pointing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 71282]), Text sample: But I reckon mrs Spencer described it so's you could tell."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45120]), Text sample: "No, she didn't-really she didn't.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 96478]), Text sample: All she said might just as well have been about most of those other places.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147600]), Text sample: Villefort's conduct, therefore, upon reflection, appeared to the baroness as if shaped for their mutual advantage.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 179760]), Text sample: She would invoke the past, recall old recollections; she would supplicate him by the remembrance of guilty, yet happy days.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57121]), Text sample: "Do you intend opening the door?" said the baroness.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 62160]), Text sample: "Who am I? You know me well enough."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41760]), Text sample: "Oh, this is too much!"

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 193919]), Text sample: She had not long to wait; directly afterwards the door was opened wide enough to admit her, and when she had passed through, it was again shut.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67678]), Text sample: "A mischance?" repeated the baroness.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 201839]), Text sample: "Your daughter will be married to morrow, if not to day-in a week, if not to morrow; and I do not think you can regret the intended husband of your daughter."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 105599]), Text sample: Come, forget him for a moment, and instead of pursuing him let him go."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 69600]), Text sample: "You are too late, madame; the orders are issued."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49681]), Text sample: "At least keep him there till my daughter be married."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 77039]), Text sample: "I was not thinking of that," replied Madame Danglars quickly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 267599]), Text sample: You could not help thinking of it, and saying to yourself, 'you, who pursue crime so vindictively, answer now, why are there unpunished crimes in your dwelling?'" The baroness became pale.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24000]), Text sample: "Well, I own it."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63120]), Text sample: "No one; his parents are unknown."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45358]), Text sample: What am I?--the law.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54958]), Text sample: Has the law any eyes to witness your grief?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63838]), Text sample: Has the law ears to be melted by your sweet voice?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 111120]), Text sample: You will tell me that I am a living being, and not a code-a man, and not a volume.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 25922]), Text sample: Have they loved me?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34319]), Text sample: Have they spared me?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74880]), Text sample: No, madame, they struck me, always struck me!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 206162]), Text sample: I have always found them; and more,--I repeat it with joy, with triumph,--I have always found some proof of human perversity or error.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 31682]), Text sample: "The weakness of a murderer!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44402]), Text sample: "His dishonor reflects upon us."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 87360]), Text sample: They went up by the stair, because they thought this would make a better impression.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 38400]), Text sample: Because, if so, we can go away."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51360]), Text sample: "I always cut their hair myself," said Wendy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74640]), Text sample: Then he burst into tears, and the truth came out.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64800]), Text sample: "I don't think he is a cypher," Tootles cried instantly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20880]), Text sample: "No, I don't.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20160]), Text sample: "Rather not.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39120]), Text sample: "Oh dear, are you going away?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 14880]), Text sample: "Yes."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 13680]), Text sample: "no"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33840]), Text sample: "About me, peter?"

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58800]), Text sample: "Would you send me to school?" he inquired craftily.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 16320]), Text sample: "Yes."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 31920]), Text sample: "And then to an office?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23520]), Text sample: "I suppose so."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32160]), Text sample: "I don't want to be a man.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 166560]), Text sample: "peter," said Wendy the comforter, "I should love you in a beard;" and mrs Darling stretched out her arms to him, but he repulsed her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 75840]), Text sample: "Keep back, lady, no one is going to catch me and make me a man."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 31680]), Text sample: "But where are you going to live?"

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24000]), Text sample: "I shall have Tink."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 96960]), Text sample: "Tink can't go a twentieth part of the way round," she reminded him a little tartly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 84720]), Text sample: "Sneaky tell tale!" Tink called out from somewhere round the corner.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37920]), Text sample: "It doesn't matter," peter said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39840]), Text sample: "O peter, you know it matters."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44640]), Text sample: "Well, then, come with me to the little house."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 25680]), Text sample: "Certainly not.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 194160]), Text sample: Wendy would have preferred a more permanent arrangement; and it seemed to her that spring would be long in coming; but this promise sent peter away quite gay again.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 108240]), Text sample: I suppose it was because Wendy knew this that her last words to him were these rather plaintive ones:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82800]), Text sample: "You won't forget me, peter, will you, before spring cleaning time comes?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52800]), Text sample: Of course peter promised; and then he flew away.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45600]), Text sample: He took mrs Darling's kiss with him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 87120]), Text sample: The kiss that had been for no one else, peter took quite easily.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 12960]), Text sample: Funny.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 30720]), Text sample: But she seemed satisfied.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 219120]), Text sample: Of course all the boys went to school; and most of them got into Class three, but Slightly was put first into Class four and then into Class five Class one is the top class.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58320]), Text sample: In time they could not even fly after their hats.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 116160]), Text sample: Want of practice, they called it; but what it really meant was that they no longer believed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 150720]), Text sample: Michael believed longer than the other boys, though they jeered at him; so he was with Wendy when peter came for her at the end of the first year.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66000]), Text sample: "I forget them after I kill them," he replied carelessly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 117600]), Text sample: When she expressed a doubtful hope that Tinker Bell would be glad to see her he said, "Who is Tinker Bell?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 111360]), Text sample: "O peter," she said, shocked; but even when she explained he could not remember.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37200]), Text sample: "There are such a lot of them," he said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 31920]), Text sample: "I expect she is no more."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 131280]), Text sample: I expect he was right, for fairies don't live long, but they are so little that a short time seems a good while to them.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 134400]), Text sample: But he was exactly as fascinating as ever, and they had a lovely spring cleaning in the little house on the tree tops.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43440]), Text sample: "Perhaps he is ill," Michael said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 241921]), Text sample: Michael came close to her and whispered, with a shiver, "Perhaps there is no such person, Wendy!" and then Wendy would have cried if Michael had not been crying.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 175199]), Text sample: For a little longer she tried for his sake not to have growing pains; and she felt she was untrue to him when she got a prize for general knowledge.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 257520]), Text sample: But the years came and went without bringing the careless boy; and when they met again Wendy was a married woman, and peter was no more to her than a little dust in the box in which she had kept her toys.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 28801]), Text sample: Wendy was grown up.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32640]), Text sample: You need not be sorry for her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42720]), Text sample: She was one of the kind that likes to grow up.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 88801]), Text sample: In the end she grew up of her own free will a day quicker than other girls.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 127440]), Text sample: All the boys were grown up and done for by this time; so it is scarcely worth while saying anything more about them.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 128159]), Text sample: You may see the twins and Nibs and Curly any day going to an office, each carrying a little bag and an umbrella.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58320]), Text sample: You see that judge in a wig coming out at the iron door?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 30480]), Text sample: That used to be Tootles.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 107759]), Text sample: The bearded man who doesn't know any story to tell his children was once john.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82080]), Text sample: When she was old enough to ask them they were mostly about peter Pan.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 158159]), Text sample: She loved to hear of peter, and Wendy told her all she could remember in the very nursery from which the famous flight had taken place.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 144479]), Text sample: There were only two beds in the nursery now, Jane's and her nurse's; and there was no kennel, for Nana also had passed away.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 189600]), Text sample: She died of old age, and at the end she had been rather difficult to get on with; being very firmly convinced that no one knew how to look after children except herself.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 110880]), Text sample: Once a week Jane's nurse had her evening off; and then it was Wendy's part to put Jane to bed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43199]), Text sample: That was the time for stories.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 144960]), Text sample: "I don't think I see anything to night," says Wendy, with a feeling that if Nana were here she would object to further conversation.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 55440]), Text sample: "That is a long time ago, sweetheart," says Wendy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 29040]), Text sample: "Yes, you did."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45839]), Text sample: "The dear old days when I could fly!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37440]), Text sample: "Why can't you fly now, mother?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42241]), Text sample: When people grow up they forget the way."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33359]), Text sample: "Why do they forget the way?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72240]), Text sample: It is only the gay and innocent and heartless who can fly."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48238]), Text sample: "What is gay and innocent and heartless?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52560]), Text sample: Or perhaps Wendy admits she does see something.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54000]), Text sample: "I do believe it is," says Jane.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 180959]), Text sample: "The foolish fellow," says Wendy, "tried to stick it on with soap, and when he could not he cried, and that woke me, and I sewed it on for him."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 102240]), Text sample: "You have missed a bit," interrupts Jane, who now knows the story better than her mother.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90000]), Text sample: "I sat up in bed and I said, 'Boy, why are you crying?'"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 84961]), Text sample: "Yes, that was it," says Jane, with a big breath.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 55199]), Text sample: "Yes! which did you like best of all?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56401]), Text sample: "I think I liked the home under the ground best of all."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 91681]), Text sample: "Yes, so do i What was the last thing peter ever said to you?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 160560]), Text sample: "The last thing he ever said to me was, 'Just always be waiting for me, and then some night you will hear me crowing.'"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 17521]), Text sample: "Yes."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 124560]), Text sample: "But, alas, he forgot all about me," Wendy said it with a smile.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34800]), Text sample: She was as grown up as that.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68399]), Text sample: "What did his crow sound like?" Jane asked one evening.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 30240]), Text sample: Wendy was a little startled.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34080]), Text sample: "My darling, how can you know?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45600]), Text sample: And then one night came the tragedy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 212401]), Text sample: Wendy was sitting on the floor, very close to the fire, so as to see to darn, for there was no other light in the nursery; and while she sat darning she heard a crow.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 113281]), Text sample: He was exactly the same as ever, and Wendy saw at once that he still had all his first teeth.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52560]), Text sample: He was a little boy, and she was grown up.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 124322]), Text sample: She huddled by the fire not daring to move, helpless and guilty, a big woman.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 95039]), Text sample: Something inside her was crying "Woman, Woman, let go of me."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 79200]), Text sample: "That is not Michael," she said quickly, lest a judgment should fall on her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 15118]), Text sample: "Yes."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 19680]), Text sample: "Boy or girl?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 12240]), Text sample: "Girl."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51840]), Text sample: Now surely he would understand; but not a bit of it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 157921]), Text sample: "Of course; that is why I have come." He added a little sternly, "Have you forgotten that this is spring cleaning time?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33839]), Text sample: "What is it?" he cried, shrinking.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57359]), Text sample: Then she turned up the light, and peter saw.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 154560]), Text sample: He gave a cry of pain; and when the tall beautiful creature stooped to lift him in her arms he drew back sharply.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33121]), Text sample: "What is it?" he cried again.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45361]), Text sample: I am ever so much more than twenty.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 31679]), Text sample: I grew up long ago."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32400]), Text sample: "You promised not to!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 26162]), Text sample: "I couldn't help it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 19201]), Text sample: "No, you're not."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52802]), Text sample: "Yes, and the little girl in the bed is my baby."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 22802]), Text sample: "No, she's not."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32880]), Text sample: Of course he did not strike.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82561]), Text sample: peter continued to cry, and soon his sobs woke Jane.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56642]), Text sample: She sat up in bed, and was interested at once.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 76799]), Text sample: peter rose and bowed to her, and she bowed to him from the bed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64081]), Text sample: "My name is peter Pan," he told her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20162]), Text sample: "Yes, I know."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66721]), Text sample: "Yes, I know," Jane said, "I have been waiting for you."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 217922]), Text sample: When Wendy returned diffidently she found peter sitting on the bed post crowing gloriously, while Jane in her nighty was flying round the room in solemn ecstasy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51841]), Text sample: "He does so need a mother," Jane said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 28561]), Text sample: Wendy rushed to the window.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45601]), Text sample: "No, no," she cried.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 131282]), Text sample: "It is just for spring cleaning time," Jane said, "he wants me always to do his spring cleaning."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 341522]), Text sample: Jane is now a common grown up, with a daughter called Margaret; and every spring cleaning time, except when he forgets, peter comes for Margaret and takes her to the Neverland, where she tells him stories about himself, to which he listens eagerly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33600]), Text sample: CHAPTER eleven
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 348720]), Text sample: He carried out his resolve with a great deal of tact, and the young lady found in renewed contact with him no obstacle to the exercise of her genius for unshrinking enquiry, the general application of her confidence.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 287760]), Text sample: I don't like Miss Stackpole-everything about her displeases me; she talks so much too loud and looks at one as if one wanted to look at her-which one doesn't.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 100080]), Text sample: She'd like Gardencourt a great deal better if it were a boarding house.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66240]), Text sample: For me, I find it almost too much of one!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 103920]), Text sample: We shall never get on together therefore, and there's no use trying."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 133920]), Text sample: This contribution to the discussion, however, Miss Stackpole rejected with scorn.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39120]), Text sample: Middling indeed!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 152640]), Text sample: If they were not the best in the world they were the worst, but there was nothing middling about an American hotel.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74400]), Text sample: "I don't know what you mean," Henrietta replied.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60960]), Text sample: "I like to be treated as an American lady."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99600]), Text sample: "They're the companions of freemen," Henrietta retorted.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 135360]), Text sample: "They're the companions of their servants-the Irish chambermaid and the negro waiter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34080]), Text sample: They share their work."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 159120]), Text sample: "Do you call the domestics in an American household 'slaves'?" Miss Stackpole enquired.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 101520]), Text sample: "If that's the way you desire to treat them, no wonder you don't like America."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 125040]), Text sample: "They're very bad in America, but I've five perfect ones in Florence."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 112080]), Text sample: "Should you like me better if I were your butler, dear?" her husband asked.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 87120]), Text sample: "I don't think I should: you wouldn't at all have the tenue."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 170400]), Text sample: "The companions of freemen-I like that, Miss Stackpole," said Ralph. "It's a beautiful description."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 79680]), Text sample: And this was the only reward that Ralph got for his compliment.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 293040]), Text sample: It was perhaps because her mind was oppressed with this image that she suffered some days to elapse before she took occasion to say to Isabel: "My dear friend, I wonder if you're growing faithless."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 21360]), Text sample: "Faithless?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51840]), Text sample: Faithless to you, Henrietta?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82800]), Text sample: "No, that would be a great pain; but it's not that."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43440]), Text sample: "Faithless to my country then?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57120]), Text sample: "Ah, that I hope will never be.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47520]), Text sample: You've never asked me what it is.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42960]), Text sample: Is it because you've suspected?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 28800]), Text sample: "Suspected what?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68400]), Text sample: As a rule I don't think I suspect," said Isabel.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 111360]), Text sample: "I remember now that phrase in your letter, but I confess I had forgotten it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35040]), Text sample: What have you to tell me?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 186720]), Text sample: Henrietta looked disappointed, and her steady gaze betrayed it. "You don't ask that right-as if you thought it important.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 77760]), Text sample: You're changed-you're thinking of other things."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64080]), Text sample: "Tell me what you mean, and I'll think of that."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35520]), Text sample: "Will you really think of it?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43920]), Text sample: That's what I wish to be sure of."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 115920]), Text sample: "I've not much control of my thoughts, but I'll do my best," said Isabel.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 261840]), Text sample: Henrietta gazed at her, in silence, for a period which tried Isabel's patience, so that our heroine added at last: "Do you mean that you're going to be married?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 81120]), Text sample: "Not till I've seen Europe!" said Miss Stackpole.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 100561]), Text sample: "What I mean is that mr Goodwood came out in the steamer with me."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51359]), Text sample: "Ah!" Isabel responded.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33601]), Text sample: "You say that right.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 81121]), Text sample: I had a good deal of talk with him; he has come after you."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37681]), Text sample: "Did he tell you so?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 246000]), Text sample: "No, he told me nothing; that's how I knew it," said Henrietta cleverly. "He said very little about you, but I spoke of you a good deal."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 26640]), Text sample: Isabel waited.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 96959]), Text sample: At the mention of mr Goodwood's name she had turned a little pale.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82079]), Text sample: "I'm very sorry you did that," she observed at last.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 161520]), Text sample: I could have talked a long time to such a listener; he was so quiet, so intense; he drank it all in."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66719]), Text sample: "What did you say about me?" Isabel asked.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72719]), Text sample: "I said you were on the whole the finest creature I know."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 118080]), Text sample: I see his face now, and his earnest absorbed look while I talked.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64800]), Text sample: I never saw an ugly man look so handsome."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99840]), Text sample: "It's not a grand passion; I'm very sure it's not that."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 70560]), Text sample: "I shall say it better to mr Goodwood himself."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 139680]), Text sample: Isabel offered no answer to this assertion, which her companion made with an air of great confidence.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65519]), Text sample: "He'll find you changed," the latter pursued.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24961]), Text sample: "Very likely.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 40801]), Text sample: I'm affected by everything."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 144719]), Text sample: Isabel failed even to smile back and in a moment she said: "Did he ask you to speak to me?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 118798]), Text sample: But his eyes asked it-and his handshake, when he bade me good bye."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 71762]), Text sample: "Thank you for doing so." And Isabel turned away.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 120959]), Text sample: "Yes, you're changed; you've got new ideas over here," her friend continued.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 120240]), Text sample: "I hope so," said Isabel; "one should get as many new ideas as possible."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 123118]), Text sample: "Yes; but they shouldn't interfere with the old ones when the old ones have been the right ones."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47039]), Text sample: Isabel turned about again.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 174000]), Text sample: "If you mean that I had any idea with regard to mr Goodwood-!" But she faltered before her friend's implacable glitter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 79680]), Text sample: "My dear child, you certainly encouraged him."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 190319]), Text sample: Isabel made for the moment as if to deny this charge; instead of which, however, she presently answered: "It's very true.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 164640]), Text sample: I did encourage him." And then she asked if her companion had learned from mr Goodwood what he intended to do.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 106800]), Text sample: "I asked him, and he said he meant to do nothing," Miss Stackpole answered.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 87601]), Text sample: "But I don't believe that; he's not a man to do nothing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 59521]), Text sample: He is a man of high, bold action.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 198961]), Text sample: "I quite believe that." Henrietta might be wanting in delicacy, but it touched the girl, all the same, to hear this declaration.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 87841]), Text sample: "Ah, you do care for him!" her visitor rang out.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 84000]), Text sample: "Whatever he does will always be right," Isabel repeated.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 134880]), Text sample: "When a man's of that infallible mould what does it matter to him what one feels?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 85440]), Text sample: "It may not matter to him, but it matters to one's self."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 143281]), Text sample: "Ah, what it matters to me-that's not what we're discussing," said Isabel with a cold smile.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47521]), Text sample: This time her companion was grave.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58560]), Text sample: "Well, I don't care; you have changed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 119759]), Text sample: You're not the girl you were a few short weeks ago, and mr Goodwood will see it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48000]), Text sample: I expect him here any day."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68399]), Text sample: "I hope he'll hate me then," said Isabel.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 91202]), Text sample: "I believe you hope it about as much as I believe him capable of it."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 195600]), Text sample: She pretended to herself, however, that she thought the event impossible, and, later, she communicated her disbelief to her friend.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 354480]), Text sample: The feeling pressed upon her; it made the air sultry, as if there were to be a change of weather; and the weather, socially speaking, had been so agreeable during Isabel's stay at Gardencourt that any change would be for the worse.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 85199]), Text sample: Her suspense indeed was dissipated the second day.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 428159]), Text sample: She entertained herself for some moments with talking to the little terrier, as to whom the proposal of an ownership divided with her cousin had been applied as impartially as possible-as impartially as Bunchie's own somewhat fickle and inconstant sympathies would allow.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 257280]), Text sample: But she was notified for the first time, on this occasion, of the finite character of Bunchie's intellect; hitherto she had been mainly struck with its extent.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 343681]), Text sample: It seemed to her at last that she would do well to take a book; formerly, when heavy hearted, she had been able, with the help of some well chosen volume, to transfer the seat of consciousness to the organ of pure reason.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 512880]), Text sample: Of late, it was not to be denied, literature had seemed a fading light, and even after she had reminded herself that her uncle's library was provided with a complete set of those authors which no gentleman's collection should be without, she sat motionless and empty handed, her eyes bent on the cool green turf of the lawn.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 133919]), Text sample: Her meditations were presently interrupted by the arrival of a servant who handed her a letter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 289681]), Text sample: The letter bore the London postmark and was addressed in a hand she knew-that came into her vision, already so held by him, with the vividness of the writer's voice or his face.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 97200]), Text sample: This document proved short and may be given entire.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 227279]), Text sample: MY DEAR MISS ARCHER-I don't know whether you will have heard of my coming to England, but even if you have not it will scarcely be a surprise to you.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 199440]), Text sample: I protested against it. You in fact appeared to accept my protest and to admit that I had the right on my side.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 251519]), Text sample: I had come to see you with the hope that you would let me bring you over to my conviction; my reasons for entertaining this hope had been of the best.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 212161]), Text sample: You admitted that you were unreasonable, and it was the only concession you would make; but it was a very cheap one, because that's not your character.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 128161]), Text sample: No, you are not, and you never will be, arbitrary or capricious.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 141841]), Text sample: You told me that I'm not disagreeable to you, and I believe it; for I don't see why that should be.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 111358]), Text sample: If I like this country at present it is only because it holds you.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 86880]), Text sample: I have been to England before, but have never enjoyed it much.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 199680]), Text sample: "I hope that we shall both forget this unhappy morning and that you will give me an opportunity of rendering to you in person, the apologies which are due to you.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 177120]), Text sample: I feel that anything less will neither rehabilitate me in your esteem, nor secure for me the remnants of my shattered self respect.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 308640]), Text sample: "I am hoping you will dine with me next week and meet a most interesting man, George Gathercole, who has just returned from Patagonia,--I only received his letter this morning- having made most remarkable discoveries concerning that country.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 254880]), Text sample: "I feel sure that you are large enough minded and too much a man of the world to allow my foolish fit of temper to disturb a relationship which I have always hoped would be mutually pleasant.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 301680]), Text sample: If you will allow Gathercole, who will be unconscious of the part he is playing, to act as peacemaker between yourself and myself, I shall feel that his trip, which has cost me a large sum of money, will not have been wasted.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49440]), Text sample: "I am, dear mr Meredith,
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 29040]), Text sample: "REMINGTON KARA."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68640]), Text sample: Kara folded the letter and inserted it in its envelope.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 148800]), Text sample: He rang a bell on his table and the girl who had so filled t x with a sense of awe came from an adjoining room.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52800]), Text sample: "You will see that this is delivered, Miss Holland."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68160]), Text sample: Kara rose from his desk and began to pace the room.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67200]), Text sample: "Do you know t x Meredith?" he asked suddenly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 40560]), Text sample: "I have heard of him," said the girl.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 148800]), Text sample: "A man with a singular mind," said Kara; "a man against whom my favourite weapon would fail."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51840]), Text sample: She looked at him with interest in her eyes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 75120]), Text sample: "What is your favourite weapon, mr Kara?" she asked.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 159600]), Text sample: Probably he required no such encouragement, for in the presence of his social inferiors he was somewhat monopolizing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57120]), Text sample: "Cut a man's flesh and it heals," he said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 141360]), Text sample: Fear is a tyrant and a despot, more terrible than the rack, more potent than the stake.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60240]), Text sample: "Is that your creed?" she asked quietly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48960]), Text sample: "Part of it, Miss Holland," he smiled.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 146160]), Text sample: She played idly with the letter she held in her hand, balancing it on the edge of the desk, her eyes downcast.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 83280]), Text sample: "What would justify the use of such an awful weapon?" she asked.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 79200]), Text sample: "It is amply justified to secure an end," he said blandly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 179280]), Text sample: "For example-I want something-I cannot obtain that something through the ordinary channel or by the employment of ordinary means.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44640]), Text sample: If I can buy it, well and good.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 114480]), Text sample: If I can buy those who can use their influence to secure this thing for me, so much the better.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 213360]), Text sample: If I can obtain it by any merit I possess, I utilize that merit, providing always, that I can secure my object in the time, otherwise-"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32400]), Text sample: He shrugged his shoulders.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64800]), Text sample: "I see," she said, nodding her head quickly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54480]), Text sample: "I suppose that is how blackmailers feel."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 97440]), Text sample: "That is a word I never use, nor do I like to hear it employed," he said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89040]), Text sample: "Blackmail suggests to me a vulgar attempt to obtain money."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 213120]), Text sample: "Which is generally very badly wanted by the people who use it," said the girl, with a little smile, "and, according to your argument, they are also justified."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58320]), Text sample: "It is a matter of plane," he said airily.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 186240]), Text sample: "Viewed from my standpoint, they are sordid criminals-the sort of person that t x meets, I presume, in the course of his daily work.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 143760]), Text sample: t x," he went on somewhat oracularly, "is a man for whom I have a great deal of respect.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 132720]), Text sample: You will probably meet him again, for he will find an opportunity of asking you a few questions about myself.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 38880]), Text sample: I need hardly tell you-"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60000]), Text sample: He lifted his shoulders with a deprecating smile.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99600]), Text sample: "I shall certainly not discuss your business with any person," said the girl coldly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 73680]), Text sample: "I am paying you three pounds a week, I think," he said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 104880]), Text sample: "I intend increasing that to five pounds because you suit me most admirably."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 116880]), Text sample: "Thank you," said the girl quietly, "but I am already being paid quite sufficient."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 92640]), Text sample: She left him, a little astonished and not a little ruffled.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 129840]), Text sample: To refuse the favours of Remington Kara was, by him, regarded as something of an affront.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 213360]), Text sample: Half his quarrel with t x was that gentleman's curious indifference to the benevolent attitude which Kara had persistently adopted in his dealings with the detective.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66480]), Text sample: He rang the bell, this time for his valet.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 328320]), Text sample: "Fisher," he said, "I am expecting a visit from a gentleman named Gathercole-a one armed gentleman whom you must look after if he comes. Detain him on some pretext or other because he is rather difficult to get hold of and I want to see him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 69360]), Text sample: Do whatever you can to prevent him going away until I return.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74400]), Text sample: He will probably be interested if you take him into the library."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 102240]), Text sample: "Very good, sir," said the urbane Fisher, "will you change before you go out?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 27840]), Text sample: Kara shook his head.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48000]), Text sample: "I think I will go as I am," he said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 28560]), Text sample: "Get me my fur coat.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 117600]), Text sample: This beastly cold kills me," he shivered as he glanced into the bleak street.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 120960]), Text sample: "Keep my fire going, put all my private letters in my bedroom, and see that Miss Holland has her lunch."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 164160]), Text sample: Fisher followed him to his car, wrapped the fur rug about his legs, closed the door carefully and returned to the house.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 102000]), Text sample: From thence onward his behaviour was somewhat extraordinary for a well bred servant.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 107760]), Text sample: That he should return to Kara's study and set the papers in order was natural and proper.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 81600]), Text sample: Kara was given to making friends of his servants-up to a point.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 232080]), Text sample: In his more generous moments he would address his bodyguard as "Fred," and on more occasions than one, and for no apparent reason, had tipped his servant over and above his salary.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 270720]), Text sample: mr Fred Fisher found little to reward him for his search until he came upon Kara's cheque book which told him that on the previous day the Greek had drawn six thousand pounds in cash from the bank.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 166800]), Text sample: This interested him mightily and he replaced the cheque book with the tightened lips and the fixed gaze of a man who was thinking rapidly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 293760]), Text sample: He paid a visit to the library, where the secretary was engaged in making copies of Kara's correspondence, answering letters appealing for charitable donations, and in the hack words which fall to the secretaries of the great.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 140400]), Text sample: He replenished the fire, asked deferentially for any instructions and returned again to his quest.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 76080]), Text sample: This time he made the bedroom the scene of his investigations.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48480]), Text sample: This however yielded no result.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 160320]), Text sample: By the side of the bed on a small table was a telephone, the sight of which apparently afforded the servant a little amusement.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43680]), Text sample: "Rum cove," said Fisher.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 248880]), Text sample: He paused for a moment before the closed door of the room and smilingly surveyed the great steel latch which spanned the door and fitted into an iron socket securely screwed to the framework.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 200880]), Text sample: He lifted it gingerly-there was a little knob for the purpose-and let it fall gently into the socket which had been made to receive it on the door itself.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 186000]), Text sample: "Rum cove," he said again, and lifting the latch to the hook which held it up, left the room, closing the door softly behind him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 127921]), Text sample: He walked down the corridor, with a meditative frown, and began to descend the stairs to the hall.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 109681]), Text sample: He was less than half-way down when the one maid of Kara's household came up to meet him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 93360]), Text sample: "There's a gentleman who wants to see mr Kara," she said, "here is his card."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 73199]), Text sample: Fisher took the card from the salver and read, "mr
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60960]), Text sample: George Gathercole, Junior Travellers' Club."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74880]), Text sample: "I'll see this gentleman," he said, with a sudden brisk interest.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 157199]), Text sample: He was a man who would have attracted attention, if only from the somewhat eccentric nature of his dress and his unkempt appearance.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 282000]), Text sample: He was dressed in a well worn overcoat of a somewhat pronounced check, he had a top hat, glossy and obviously new, at the back of his head, and the lower part of his face was covered by a ragged beard.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 237121]), Text sample: This he was plucking with nervous jerks, talking to himself the while, and casting a disparaging eye upon the portrait of Remington Kara which hung above the marble fireplace.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 150481]), Text sample: A pair of pince nez sat crookedly on his nose and two fat volumes under his arm completed the picture.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 215040]), Text sample: Fisher, who was an observer of some discernment, noticed under the overcoat a creased blue suit, large black boots and a pair of pearl studs.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47760]), Text sample: The newcomer glared round at the valet.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 86639]), Text sample: "Take these!" he ordered peremptorily, pointing to the books under his arm.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 176880]), Text sample: Accidentally the valet's hand pressed against the other's sleeve and he received a shock, for the forearm was clearly an artificial one.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 316560]), Text sample: It was against a wooden surface beneath the sleeve that his knuckles struck, and this view of the stranger's infirmity was confirmed when the other reached round with his right hand, took hold of the gloved left hand and thrust it into the pocket of his overcoat.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52079]), Text sample: "Where is Kara?" growled the stranger.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 75601]), Text sample: "He will be back very shortly, sir," said the urbane Fisher.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46080]), Text sample: "Out, is he?" boomed the visitor.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32161]), Text sample: "Then I shan't wait.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47279]), Text sample: What the devil does he mean by being out?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48480]), Text sample: He's had three years to be out!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48481]), Text sample: "mr Kara expects you, sir.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 69120]), Text sample: He told me he would be in at six o'clock at the latest."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57601]), Text sample: "What dog am I that I should wait till six?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51120]), Text sample: He gave a savage little tug at his beard.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 26880]), Text sample: "Six o'clock, eh?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49199]), Text sample: You will tell mr Kara that I called.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 26400]), Text sample: Give me those books."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 55680]), Text sample: "But I assure you, sir,--" stammered Fisher.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 55202]), Text sample: "Give me those books!" roared the other.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 270480]), Text sample: Deftly he lifted his left hand from the pocket, crooked the elbow by some quick manipulation, and thrust the books, which the valet most reluctantly handed to him, back to the place from whence he had taken them.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 21840]), Text sample: Good morning to you."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72481]), Text sample: "If you would only wait, sir," pleaded the agonized Fisher.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48959]), Text sample: "I've waited three years, I tell you.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64080]), Text sample: Tell mr Kara to expect me when he sees me!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45120]), Text sample: Fisher went back to the library.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74880]), Text sample: The girl was sealing up some letters as he entered and looked up.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 91921]), Text sample: "I am afraid, Miss Holland, I've got myself into very serious trouble."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48240]), Text sample: "What is that, Fisher!" asked the girl.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 117120]), Text sample: "There was a gentleman coming to see mr Kara, whom mr Kara particularly wanted to see."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46560]), Text sample: "mr Gathercole," said the girl quickly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20401]), Text sample: Fisher nodded.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51121]), Text sample: "Yes, miss, I couldn't get him to stay though."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 40801]), Text sample: She pursed her lips thoughtfully.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90238]), Text sample: "mr Kara will be very cross, but I don't see how you can help it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35520]), Text sample: I wish you had called me."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 141601]), Text sample: "He never gave a chance, miss," said Fisher, with a little smile, "but if he comes again I'll show him straight up to you."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 19200]), Text sample: She nodded.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78960]), Text sample: "Is there anything you want, miss?" he asked as he stood at the door.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 59280]), Text sample: "What time did mr Kara say he would be back?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53519]), Text sample: "At six o'clock, miss," the man replied.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39840]), Text sample: "Shall I ring up for a messenger?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56640]), Text sample: "No, I don't think that would be advisable.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35280]), Text sample: You had better take it yourself."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47520]), Text sample: "I will go with pleasure, miss," he said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 264721]), Text sample: He put it carefully in his pocket and went from the room to change. Large as the house was Kara did not employ a regular staff of servants. A maid and a valet comprised the whole of the indoor staff.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147361]), Text sample: His cook, and the other domestics, necessary for conducting an establishment of that size, were engaged by the day.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 294961]), Text sample: Kara had returned from the country earlier than had been anticipated, and, save for Fisher, the only other person in the house beside the girl, was the middle aged domestic who was parlour maid, serving maid and housekeeper in one.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 176880]), Text sample: She heard the soft thud of the front door closing, and rising she crossed the room rapidly and looked down through the window to the street.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 213599]), Text sample: It was not the first visit she had made to the big underground room with its vaulted roof and its great ranges-which were seldom used nowadays, for Kara gave no dinners.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 77279]), Text sample: The maid-who was also cook-arose up as the girl entered.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 94560]), Text sample: "It's a sight for sore eyes to see you in my kitchen, miss," she smiled.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 84959]), Text sample: "I'm afraid you're rather lonely, mrs Beale," said the girl sympathetically.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47041]), Text sample: It's that door that gives me the hump."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 108000]), Text sample: She pointed to the far end of the kitchen to a soiled looking door of unpainted wood.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 106319]), Text sample: I know he goes in sometimes because I tried a dodge that my brother-who's a policeman-taught me.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 131280]), Text sample: "mr Kara keeps some of his private papers in there," said the girl quietly, "he has told me so himself."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33118]), Text sample: Miss Holland laughed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 73202]), Text sample: "I want you to go out now," she said, "I have no stamps."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 252959]), Text sample: mrs Beale obeyed with alacrity and whilst she was assuming a hat-being desirous of maintaining her prestige as housekeeper in the eyes of Cadogan Square, the girl ascended to the upper floor.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 70320]), Text sample: Again she watched from the window the disappearing figure.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 71760]), Text sample: From her bag she produced a small purse and opened it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56400]), Text sample: In that case was a new steel key.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 100800]), Text sample: She passed swiftly down the corridor to Kara's room and made straight for the safe.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89520]), Text sample: In two seconds it was open and she was examining its contents.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54960]), Text sample: It was a large safe of the usual type.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 100801]), Text sample: There were four steel drawers fitted at the back and at the bottom of the strong box.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39839]), Text sample: The top pair were locked.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 111600]), Text sample: She was prepared for this contingency and a second key was as efficacious as the first.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 93360]), Text sample: An examination of the first drawer did not produce all that she had expected.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 91200]), Text sample: She returned the papers to the drawer, pushed it to and locked it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53041]), Text sample: She gave her attention to the second drawer.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 50640]), Text sample: Her hand shook a little as she pulled it open.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 61680]), Text sample: It was her last chance, her last hope.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 83760]), Text sample: There were a number of small jewel boxes almost filling the drawer.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 181202]), Text sample: She took them out one by one and at the bottom she found what she had been searching for and that which had filled her thoughts for the past three months.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 69599]), Text sample: It was a square case covered in red morocco leather.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 25440]), Text sample: CHAPTER twelve
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 123360]), Text sample: What started the train of thought he did not know, but at that moment his mind was very far away.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 110640]), Text sample: He remembered the day well because it was Candlemas day, and this was the anniversary.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49440]), Text sample: He remembered other things more pleasant.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 158880]), Text sample: The beat of hoofs on the rocky roadway, the crash of the door falling in when the Turkish Gendarmes had battered a way to his rescue.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 244560]), Text sample: He remembered with a savage joy the spectacle of his would be assassins twitching and struggling on the gallows at Pezara and-he heard the faint tinkle of the front door bell.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37440]), Text sample: Had t x returned!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 96720]), Text sample: He slipped from the bed and went to the door, opened it slightly and listened.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 159360]), Text sample: t x with a search warrant might be a source of panic especially if-he shrugged his shoulders.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63600]), Text sample: He had satisfied t x and allayed his suspicions.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65760]), Text sample: He would get Fisher out of the way that night and make sure.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 59040]), Text sample: The voice from the hall below was loud and gruff.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24480]), Text sample: Who could it be!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42240]), Text sample: "Will you see mr Gathercole now!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 26640]), Text sample: "mr Gathercole!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 92400]), Text sample: Kara breathed a sigh of relief and his face was wreathed in smiles.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24480]), Text sample: Tell him to come up.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 50640]), Text sample: Ask him if he minds seeing me in my room."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 21120]), Text sample: Kara laughed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 105600]), Text sample: "Send him up," he said, and then as Fisher was going out of the room he called him back.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 92880]), Text sample: "By the way, Fisher, after mr Gathercole has gone, you may go out for the night.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 88320]), Text sample: You've got somewhere to go, I suppose, and you needn't come back until the morning."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37680]), Text sample: "Yes, sir," said the servant.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63840]), Text sample: Such an instruction was remarkably pleasing to him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 96960]), Text sample: There was much that he had to do and that night's freedom would assist him materially.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 114480]), Text sample: "Perhaps" Kara hesitated, "perhaps you had better wait until eleven o'clock.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67680]), Text sample: Bring me up some sandwiches and a large glass of milk.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 61920]), Text sample: Or better still, place them on a plate in the hall."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54240]), Text sample: "Very good, sir," said the man and withdrew.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51600]), Text sample: "mr Kara will see you, sir," said Fisher.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 114720]), Text sample: "Oh!" said the other glaring at the unoffending Fisher, "that's very good of him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 133440]), Text sample: Very good of this person to see a scholar and a gentleman who has been about his dirty business for three years.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41040]), Text sample: Grown grey in his service!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 38160]), Text sample: Do you understand that, my man!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39600]), Text sample: "Yes, sir," said Fisher.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 16560]), Text sample: "Look here!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 40320]), Text sample: The man thrust out his face.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54000]), Text sample: "Do you see those grey hairs in my beard?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48000]), Text sample: The embarrassed Fisher grinned.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64560]), Text sample: "Is it grey!" challenged the visitor, with a roar.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54240]), Text sample: "Yes, sir," said the valet hastily.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57360]), Text sample: "Is it real grey?" insisted the visitor.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32400]), Text sample: "Pull one out and see!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72480]), Text sample: The startled Fisher drew back with an apologetic smile.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58320]), Text sample: "I couldn't think of doing a thing like that, sir."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78240]), Text sample: "Oh, you couldn't," sneered the visitor; "then lead on!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44160]), Text sample: Fisher showed the way up the stairs.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57600]), Text sample: This time the traveller carried no books.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 193200]), Text sample: His left arm hung limply by his side and Fisher privately gathered that the hand had got loose from the detaining pocket without its owner being aware of the fact.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57360]), Text sample: He pushed open the door and announced, "mr
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 265200]), Text sample: Gathercole," and Kara came forward with a smile to meet his agent, who, with top hat still on the top of his head, and his overcoat dangling about his heels, must have made a remarkable picture.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89760]), Text sample: Fisher closed the door behind them and returned to his duties in the hall below.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 109200]), Text sample: Ten minutes later he heard the door opened and the booming voice of the stranger came down to him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 117840]), Text sample: "No more Patagonia!" he roared, "no more Tierra del Fuego!" he paused.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 18960]), Text sample: "Certainly!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 249840]), Text sample: He replied to some question, "but not Patagonia," he paused again, and Fisher standing at the foot of the stairs wondered what had occurred to make the visitor so genial.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 201120]), Text sample: "I suppose your cheque will be honoured all right?" asked the visitor sardonically, and then burst into a little chuckle of laughter as he carefully closed the door.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 80400]), Text sample: He came down the corridor talking to himself, and greeted Fisher.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 238800]), Text sample: "Damn all Greeks," he said jovially, and Fisher could do no more than smile reproachfully, the smile being his very own, the reproach being on behalf of the master who paid him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 69120]), Text sample: The traveller touched the other on the chest with his right hand.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89040]), Text sample: "Never trust a Greek," he said, "always get your money in advance.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 144720]), Text sample: "Yes, sir," said Fisher, "but I think you will always find that mr Kara is always most generous about money."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 97680]), Text sample: "Don't you believe it, don't you believe it, my poor man," said the other, "you-"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 84240]), Text sample: At that moment there came from Kara's room a faint "clang."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58800]), Text sample: "What's that?" asked the visitor a little startled.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 218640]), Text sample: "mr Kara's put down his steel latch," said Fisher with a smile, "which means that he is not to be disturbed until-" he looked at his watch, "until eleven o'clock at any rate."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 85920]), Text sample: "He's a funk!" snapped the other, "a beastly funk!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 209760]), Text sample: He stamped down the stairs as though testing the weight of every tread, opened the front door without assistance, slammed it behind him and disappeared into the night.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 127440]), Text sample: Fisher, his hands in his pockets, looked after the departing stranger, nodding his head in reprobation.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 91440]), Text sample: "You're a queer old devil," he said, and looked at his watch again.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53520]), Text sample: It wanted five minutes to ten.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20880]), Text sample: CHAPTER seven
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99120]), Text sample: She had, however, a peculiar taste; she liked to receive cards.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 254160]), Text sample: For what is usually called social intercourse she had very little relish; but nothing pleased her more than to find her hall table whitened with oblong morsels of symbolic pasteboard.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 157680]), Text sample: She flattered herself that she was a very just woman, and had mastered the sovereign truth that nothing in this world is got for nothing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 365040]), Text sample: But it is by no means certain that she did not feel it to be wrong that so little notice was taken of them and that her failure (really very gratuitous) to make herself important in the neighbourhood had not much to do with the acrimony of her allusions to her husband's adopted country.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 267840]), Text sample: Isabel presently found herself in the singular situation of defending the British constitution against her aunt; mrs Touchett having formed the habit of sticking pins into this venerable instrument.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 270720]), Text sample: Isabel always felt an impulse to pull out the pins; not that she imagined they inflicted any damage on the tough old parchment, but because it seemed to her her aunt might make better use of her sharpness.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 302880]), Text sample: She was very critical herself-it was incidental to her age, her sex and her nationality; but she was very sentimental as well, and there was something in mrs Touchett's dryness that set her own moral fountains flowing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78240]), Text sample: "When you criticise everything here you should have a point of view.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 199200]), Text sample: Yours doesn't seem to be American-you thought everything over there so disagreeable. When I criticise I have mine; it's thoroughly American!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65280]), Text sample: You may say that doesn't make them very numerous!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20400]), Text sample: American?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72240]), Text sample: Never in the world; that's shockingly narrow.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63360]), Text sample: My point of view, thank God, is personal!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 232320]), Text sample: Isabel thought this a better answer than she admitted; it was a tolerable description of her own manner of judging, but it would not have sounded well for her to say so.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 306000]), Text sample: Her cousin used, as the phrase is, to chaff her; he very soon established with her a reputation for treating everything as a joke, and he was not a man to neglect the privileges such a reputation conferred.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 96960]), Text sample: "I keep a band of music in my ante room," he said once to her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 106080]), Text sample: "It has orders to play without stopping; it renders me two excellent services.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 207360]), Text sample: It mattered little that he had assured her they were a very dismal place; she would have been glad to undertake to sweep them and set them in order.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 237600]), Text sample: It was but half hospitality to let her remain outside; to punish him for which Isabel administered innumerable taps with the ferule of her straight young wit.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 301920]), Text sample: It must be said that her wit was exercised to a large extent in self defence, for her cousin amused himself with calling her "Columbia" and accusing her of a patriotism so heated that it scorched.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 238080]), Text sample: Isabel's chief dread in life at this period of her development was that she should appear narrow minded; what she feared next afterwards was that she should really be so.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 462480]), Text sample: She would be as American as it pleased him to regard her, and if he chose to laugh at her she would give him plenty of occupation. She defended England against his mother, but when Ralph sang its praises on purpose, as she said, to work her up, she found herself able to differ from him on a variety of points.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 185040]), Text sample: If her good humour flagged at moments it was not because she thought herself ill used, but because she suddenly felt sorry for Ralph.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 115680]), Text sample: It seemed to her he was talking as a blind and had little heart in what he said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 132960]), Text sample: "I don't know what's the matter with you," she observed to him once; "but I suspect you're a great humbug."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 111840]), Text sample: "That's your privilege," Ralph answered, who had not been used to being so crudely addressed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 230400]), Text sample: "I don't know what you care for; I don't think you care for anything. You don't really care for England when you praise it; you don't care for America even when you pretend to abuse it."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 69840]), Text sample: "I care for nothing but you, dear cousin," said Ralph.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 80640]), Text sample: "If I could believe even that, I should be very glad."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 85440]), Text sample: Isabel might have believed it and not have been far from the truth.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 439200]), Text sample: He thought a great deal about her; she was constantly present to his mind. At a time when his thoughts had been a good deal of a burden to him her sudden arrival, which promised nothing and was an open handed gift of fate, had refreshed and quickened them, given them wings and something to fly for.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 173040]), Text sample: The old man had been gravely ill in the spring, and the doctors had whispered to Ralph that another attack would be less easy to deal with.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 260160]), Text sample: Just now he appeared disburdened of pain, but Ralph could not rid himself of a suspicion that this was a subterfuge of the enemy, who was waiting to take him off his guard.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 97680]), Text sample: If the manoeuvre should succeed there would be little hope of any great resistance.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 159600]), Text sample: Ralph had always taken for granted that his father would survive him-that his own name would be the first grimly called.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 498959]), Text sample: The father and son had been close companions, and the idea of being left alone with the remnant of a tasteless life on his hands was not gratifying to the young man, who had always and tacitly counted upon his elder's help in making the best of a poor business. At the prospect of losing his great motive Ralph lost indeed his one inspiration.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 481199]), Text sample: He bethought himself of course that it had been a small kindness to his father to wish that, of the two, the active rather than the passive party should know the felt wound; he remembered that the old man had always treated his own forecast of an early end as a clever fallacy, which he should be delighted to discredit so far as he might by dying first.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 338159]), Text sample: But of the two triumphs, that of refuting a sophistical son and that of holding on a while longer to a state of being which, with all abatements, he enjoyed, Ralph deemed it no sin to hope the latter might be vouchsafed to mr Touchett.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 119040]), Text sample: These were nice questions, but Isabel's arrival put a stop to his puzzling over them.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 186961]), Text sample: He wondered whether he were harbouring "love" for this spontaneous young woman from Albany; but he judged that on the whole he was not.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 150720]), Text sample: After he had known her for a week he quite made up his mind to this, and every day he felt a little more sure.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 141359]), Text sample: Lord Warburton had been right about her; she was a really interesting little figure.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 247680]), Text sample: Ralph wondered how their neighbour had found it out so soon; and then he said it was only another proof of his friend's high abilities, which he had always greatly admired.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 189359]), Text sample: "A character like that," he said to himself-"a real little passionate force to see at play is the finest thing in nature.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 202560]), Text sample: It's finer than the finest work of art-than a Greek bas relief, than a great Titian, than a Gothic cathedral.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 110160]), Text sample: It's very pleasant to be so well treated where one had least looked for it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 231839]), Text sample: I had never been more blue, more bored, than for a week before she came; I had never expected less that anything pleasant would happen.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 139199]), Text sample: The key of a beautiful edifice is thrust into my hand, and I'm told to walk in and admire.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 156480]), Text sample: She was intelligent and generous; it was a fine free nature; but what was she going to do with herself?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 123360]), Text sample: This question was irregular, for with most women one had no occasion to ask it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 230161]), Text sample: Most women did with themselves nothing at all; they waited, in attitudes more or less gracefully passive, for a man to come that way and furnish them with a destiny.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 131759]), Text sample: Isabel's originality was that she gave one an impression of having intentions of her own.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 101279]), Text sample: "Whenever she executes them," said Ralph, "may I be there to see!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 81120]), Text sample: It devolved upon him of course to do the honours of the place.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 296639]), Text sample: mr Touchett was confined to his chair, and his wife's position was that of rather a grim visitor; so that in the line of conduct that opened itself to Ralph duty and inclination were harmoniously mixed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 703920]), Text sample: Isabel enjoyed it largely and, handling the reins in a manner which approved itself to the groom as "knowing," was never weary of driving her uncle's capital horses through winding lanes and byways full of the rural incidents she had confidently expected to find; past cottages thatched and timbered, past ale houses latticed and sanded, past patches of ancient common and glimpses of empty parks, between hedgerows made thick by midsummer.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 226081]), Text sample: When they reached home they usually found tea had been served on the lawn and that mrs Touchett had not shrunk from the extremity of handing her husband his cup.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 383279]), Text sample: The two young persons, after spending an hour on the river, strolled back to the house and perceived Lord Warburton sitting under the trees and engaged in conversation, of which even at a distance the desultory character was appreciable, with mrs Touchett.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 326640]), Text sample: Isabel, seeing him for half an hour on the day of her arrival, had discovered in this brief space that she liked him; he had indeed rather sharply registered himself on her fine sense and she had thought of him several times.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 120721]), Text sample: She had hoped she should see him again-hoped too that she should see a few others.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 329521]), Text sample: Gardencourt was not dull; the place itself was sovereign, her uncle was more and more a sort of golden grandfather, and Ralph was unlike any cousin she had ever encountered-her idea of cousins having tended to gloom.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 188401]), Text sample: Then her impressions were still so fresh and so quickly renewed that there was as yet hardly a hint of vacancy in the view.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 361919]), Text sample: Little, however, for the present, had come of his offers, and it may be confided to the reader that if the young man delayed to carry them out it was because he found the labour of providing for his companion by no means so severe as to require extraneous help.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 345361]), Text sample: Isabel had spoken to him very often about "specimens;" it was a word that played a considerable part in her vocabulary; she had given him to understand that she wished to see English society illustrated by eminent cases.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51121]), Text sample: "A specimen of what?" asked the girl.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46798]), Text sample: "A specimen of an English gentleman."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39121]), Text sample: "Do you mean they're all like him?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48241]), Text sample: "Oh no; they're not all like him."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37200]), Text sample: "Yes, he's very nice.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 135841]), Text sample: The fortunate Lord Warburton exchanged a handshake with our heroine and hoped she was very well.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 91682]), Text sample: "But I needn't ask that," he said, "since you've been handling the oars."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 88081]), Text sample: "I've been rowing a little," Isabel answered; "but how should you know it?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 143282]), Text sample: "Oh, I know he doesn't row; he's too lazy," said his lordship, indicating Ralph Touchett with a laugh.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 150721]), Text sample: "Ah, he has a good excuse for everything!" cried Lord Warburton, still with his sonorous mirth.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 126481]), Text sample: "My excuse for not rowing is that my cousin rows so well," said Ralph. "She does everything well.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56880]), Text sample: She touches nothing that she doesn't adorn!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 424802]), Text sample: "Be touched in the right sense and you'll never look the worse for it," said Isabel, who, if it pleased her to hear it said that her accomplishments were numerous, was happily able to reflect that such complacency was not the indication of a feeble mind, inasmuch as there were several things in which she excelled.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 264481]), Text sample: Lord Warburton not only spent the night at Gardencourt, but he was persuaded to remain over the second day; and when the second day was ended he determined to postpone his departure till the morrow.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 174000]), Text sample: During this period he addressed many of his remarks to Isabel, who accepted this evidence of his esteem with a very good grace.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 372000]), Text sample: She found herself liking him extremely; the first impression he had made on her had had weight, but at the end of an evening spent in his society she scarce fell short of seeing him-though quite without luridity-as a hero of romance.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 192721]), Text sample: "It's very nice to know two such charming people as those," she said, meaning by "those" her cousin and her cousin's friend.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147841]), Text sample: It must be added moreover that an incident had occurred which might have seemed to put her good humour to the test.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 359760]), Text sample: mr Touchett went to bed at half past nine o'clock, but his wife remained in the drawing room with the other members of the party. She prolonged her vigil for something less than an hour, and then, rising, observed to Isabel that it was time they should bid the gentlemen good night.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 69358]), Text sample: So, without further thought, she replied, very simply-
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35279]), Text sample: I'll come up in half an hour."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 80400]), Text sample: "It's impossible I should wait for you," mrs Touchett answered.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68399]), Text sample: Ralph will light my candle," Isabel gaily engaged.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 139441]), Text sample: "I'll light your candle; do let me light your candle, Miss Archer!" Lord Warburton exclaimed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64081]), Text sample: "Only I beg it shall not be before midnight."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 136562]), Text sample: mrs Touchett fixed her bright little eyes upon him a moment and transferred them coldly to her niece.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90481]), Text sample: You're not-you're not at your blest Albany, my dear."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33841]), Text sample: Isabel rose, blushing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65759]), Text sample: "Oh, I say, mother!" Ralph broke out.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 84961]), Text sample: "My dear mrs Touchett!" Lord Warburton murmured.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 138000]), Text sample: "I didn't make your country, my lord," mrs Touchett said majestically. "I must take it as I find it."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 71282]), Text sample: "Can't I stay with my own cousin?" Isabel enquired.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 70561]), Text sample: "I'm not aware that Lord Warburton is your cousin."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 75120]), Text sample: "Perhaps I had better go to bed!" the visitor suggested.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 27841]), Text sample: "That will arrange it."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82802]), Text sample: mrs Touchett gave a little look of despair and sat down again.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 70081]), Text sample: Ralph meanwhile handed Isabel her candlestick.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 159601]), Text sample: He had been watching her; it had seemed to him her temper was involved-an accident that might be interesting.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 212399]), Text sample: But if he had expected anything of a flare he was disappointed, for the girl simply laughed a little, nodded good night and withdrew accompanied by her aunt.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 96481]), Text sample: For himself he was annoyed at his mother, though he thought she was right.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82321]), Text sample: Above stairs the two ladies separated at mrs Touchett's door.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52081]), Text sample: Isabel had said nothing on her way up.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 26880]), Text sample: Isabel considered.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 100322]), Text sample: "I'm not vexed, but I'm surprised-and a good deal mystified.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 61442]), Text sample: Wasn't it proper I should remain in the drawing room?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 29760]), Text sample: "Not in the least.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 134159]), Text sample: Young girls here-in decent houses-don't sit alone with the gentlemen late at night."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63601]), Text sample: "You were very right to tell me then," said Isabel.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 61682]), Text sample: "I don't understand it, but I'm very glad to know it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 164880]), Text sample: "I shall always tell you," her aunt answered, "whenever I see you taking what seems to me too much liberty."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 95519]), Text sample: "Pray do; but I don't say I shall always think your remonstrance just."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 25441]), Text sample: "Very likely not.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44880]), Text sample: You're too fond of your own ways."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 61201]), Text sample: "Yes, I think I'm very fond of them.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72721]), Text sample: But I always want to know the things one shouldn't do."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56880]), Text sample: "So as to do them?" asked her aunt.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 230640]), Text sample: In old times, when all kinds of wonderful things happened in Brittany, there lived in the village of Lanillis, a young man named Houarn Pogamm and a girl called Bellah Postik.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 221520]), Text sample: They were cousins, and as their mothers were great friends, and constantly in and out of each other's houses, they had often been laid in the same cradle, and had played and fought over their games.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 169680]), Text sample: 'Yes,' answered Bellah, with a deep sigh; 'but we live in such hard times, and at the last fair the price of pigs had risen again.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 228000]), Text sample: Whenever they met they repeated their grievances, and at length Houarn's patience was exhausted, and one morning he came to Bellah and told her that he was going away to seek his fortune.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 136560]), Text sample: The girl was very unhappy as she listened to this, and felt sorry that she had not tried to make the best of things.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 128640]), Text sample: Like them, I shall seek till I get what I want-that is, money to buy a cow and a pig to fatten.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 92880]), Text sample: The girl saw it was useless to say more, so she answered sadly:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41040]), Text sample: 'Well, go then, since you must.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 208560]), Text sample: But first I will divide with you all that my parents left me,' and going to her room, she opened a small chest, and took from it a bell, a knife, and a little stick.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 153120]), Text sample: 'This bell,' she said, 'can be heard at any distance, however far, but it only rings to warn us that our friends are in great danger.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147840]), Text sample: The knife frees all it touches from the spells that have been laid on them; while the stick will carry you wherever you want to go.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 134160]), Text sample: I will give you the knife to guard you against the enchantments of wizards, and the bell to tell me of your perils.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 94320]), Text sample: The stick I shall keep for myself, so that I can fly to you if ever you have need of me.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 123360]), Text sample: 'There is no fortune to be made here,' he thought to himself; 'it is a place for spending, and not earning.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 134880]), Text sample: I see I must go further,' and he walked on to Pont aven, a pretty little town built on the bank of a river.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 158640]), Text sample: He was sitting on a bench outside an inn, when he heard two men who were loading their mules talking about the Groac'h of the island of Lok.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 252000]), Text sample: 'I have never come across one.' And the men answered that it was the name given to the fairy that dwelt in the lake, and that she was rich-oh! richer than all the kings in the world put together.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 129120]), Text sample: Many had gone to the island to try and get possession of her treasures, but no one had ever come back.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56160]), Text sample: As he listened Houarn's mind was made up.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 146640]), Text sample: But the men did not know how this was to be done, and, shaking their heads over his obstinacy, left him to his fate.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 109920]), Text sample: So Houarn went down to the sea, and found a boatman who engaged to take him to the isle of Lok.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 126240]), Text sample: The island was large, and lying almost across it was a lake, with a narrow opening to the sea.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 140400]), Text sample: At one end he perceived a small skiff, painted blue and shaped like a swan, lying under a clump of yellow broom.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 144960]), Text sample: But the bird had guessed his intentions, and plunged beneath the water, carrying Houarn with him to the palace of the Groac'h.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 158400]), Text sample: Now, unless you have been under the sea and beheld all the wonders that lie there, you can never have an idea what the Groac'h's palace was like.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 204480]), Text sample: It was all made of shells, blue and green and pink and lilac and white, shading into each other till you could not tell where one colour ended and the other began.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 271680]), Text sample: The staircases were of crystal, and every separate stair sang like a woodland bird as you put your foot on it. Round the palace were great gardens full of all the plants that grow in the sea, with diamonds for flowers.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74880]), Text sample: At the sight of her Houarn stopped, dazzled by her beauty.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56160]), Text sample: 'Come in,' said the Groac'h, rising to her feet.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 76560]), Text sample: Do not be shy, but tell me how you found your way, and what you want.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 102960]), Text sample: 'Well, you can easily get that,' replied she; 'it is nothing to worry about.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65520]), Text sample: 'A man would be mad indeed to refuse such an offer.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42720]), Text sample: I can only accept it with joy.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 95280]), Text sample: 'Then the sooner it is done the better,' said the Groac'h, and gave orders to her servants.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 118320]), Text sample: After that was finished, she begged Houarn to accompany her to a fish pond at the bottom of the garden.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 204480]), Text sample: 'Come lawyer, come miller, come tailor, come singer!' cried she, holding out a net of steel; and at each summons a fish appeared and jumped into the net.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 197040]), Text sample: When it was full she went into a large kitchen and threw them all into a golden pot; but above the bubbling of the water Houarn seemed to hear the whispering of little voices.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 136080]), Text sample: 'The water is getting hot, and it makes the fish jump,' she replied; but soon the noise grew louder and like cries.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66960]), Text sample: 'What is it?' asked Houarn, beginning to feel uncomfortable.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 182640]), Text sample: But though Houarn held his peace, he was not as happy as before. Something seemed to have gone wrong, and then he suddenly remembered Bellah.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67921]), Text sample: 'Is it possible I can have forgotten her so soon?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 193200]), Text sample: Houarn sat down and took out the knife which Bellah had given him, but as soon as the blade touched the fish the enchantment ceased, and four men stood before him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 132000]), Text sample: Instantly she threw the steel net over his head, and the eyes of a little green frog peeped through the meshes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147841]), Text sample: It was at this very moment that Bellah, who was skimming the milk in the farm dairy, heard the fairy bell tinkle violently.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 214080]), Text sample: He stood quite still while Bellah scrambled up, then he started off, his pace growing quicker and quicker, till at length the girl could hardly see the trees and houses as they flashed past.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 110159]), Text sample: But, rapid as the pace was, it was not rapid enough for Bellah, who stooped and said:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 110640]), Text sample: 'The swallow is less swift than the wind, the wind is less swift than the lightning.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 203521]), Text sample: Here she found a nest made of clay and lined with dried moss, and in the centre a tiny man, black and wrinkled, who gave a cry of surprise at the sight of Bellah.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 40079]), Text sample: 'But what are you doing in this nest?'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48000]), Text sample: On hearing this Bellah began to laugh.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78000]), Text sample: 'Poor little cock!' she said, 'and how am I to deliver you?'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 62880]), Text sample: 'By delivering Houarn, who is in the power of the Groac'h.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 150241]), Text sample: 'Ah! tell me how I can manage that, and if I have to walk round the whole of Brittany on my bended knees I will do it!'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 145440]), Text sample: When you have found her you must contrive to get hold of the net of steel that hangs from her waist, and shut her up in it for ever.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63840]), Text sample: 'But where am I to find a young man's clothes?' asked she.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 154800]), Text sample: Without waiting for orders, they sat down in the nest and, crossing their legs comfortably, began to prepare the suit of clothes for Bellah.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 182640]), Text sample: With one of the leaves of the cabbage they made her a coat, and another served for a waistcoat; but it took two for the wide breeches which were then in fashion.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 95279]), Text sample: The hat was cut from the heart of the cabbage, and a pair of shoes from the thick stem.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 162479]), Text sample: She thanked the little men gratefully, and after a few more instructions, jumped on the back of her great bird, and was borne away to the isle of Lok.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 125039]), Text sample: The Groac'h seemed overjoyed to see her, and told her that never before had she beheld such a handsome young man.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 179519]), Text sample: Very soon she led her visitor into the great hall, where wine and fruit were always waiting, and on the table lay the magic knife, left there by Houarn.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 259200]), Text sample: Unseen by the Groac'h, Bellah hid it in a pocket of her green coat, and then followed her hostess into the garden, and to the pond which contained the fish, their sides shining with a thousand different colours.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 117841]), Text sample: Bellah took the net which the Groac'h held out, and, turning rapidly, flung it over the witch's head.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 152880]), Text sample: Bellah only drew it the tighter, and, flinging the sorceress into a pit, she rolled a great stone across the mouth, and left her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 104880]), Text sample: 'This is our lord and master, who has saved us from the net of steel and the pot of gold!'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 204961]), Text sample: But just as she was going to touch the foremost fish, her eyes fell on a green frog on his knees beside her, his little paws crossed over his little heart.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60238]), Text sample: There were so many of them that it took quite a long time.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 31921]), Text sample: 'Here I am!' he exclaimed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 194880]), Text sample: Still he would not leave the farm, and look for work elsewhere, as he might have done, for then he would never see Barbaik at all, and what was life worth to him without that?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 248880]), Text sample: He was tired with a long day's work, and stood with his hand on the mane of one of the animals, waiting till they had done, and thinking all the while of Barbaik, when a voice came out of the gorse close by.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23280]), Text sample: 'What is the matter, Jegu?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65040]), Text sample: The young man glanced up in surprise, and asked who was there.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60240]), Text sample: 'It is I, the brownie of the lake,' replied the voice.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43920]), Text sample: 'But where are you?' inquired Jegu.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 160080]), Text sample: I can take,' he added proudly, 'any shape I choose, and even, which is much harder, be invisible if I want to.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 142080]), Text sample: 'Certainly, if you wish,' and the frog jumped on the back of one of the horses, and changed into a little dwarf, all dressed in green.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 215760]), Text sample: This transformation rather frightened Jegu, but the brownie bade him have no fears, for he would not do him any harm; indeed, he hoped that Jegu might find him of some use.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82560]), Text sample: 'But why should you take all this interest in me?' asked the peasant suspiciously.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 98880]), Text sample: 'Because of a service you did me last winter, which I have never forgotten,' answered the little fellow.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 326640]), Text sample: We were therefore obliged to take refuge in distant lands, and to hide ourselves at first under different animal shapes. Since that time, partly from habit and partly to amuse ourselves, we have continued to transform ourselves, and it was in this way that I got to know you.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60240]), Text sample: 'How?' exclaimed Jegu, filled with astonishment.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 102960]), Text sample: 'Ah! my little brownie, if you can do that, there is nothing I won't give you, except my soul.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 28080]), Text sample: 'That is my affair.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35040]), Text sample: Perhaps I may tell you later.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 84480]), Text sample: Meanwhile you just eat and sleep, and don't worry yourself about anything.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 150000]), Text sample: Jegu declared that nothing could be easier, and then taking off his hat, he thanked the dwarf heartily, and led his horses back to the farm.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 237600]), Text sample: Next morning was a holiday, and Barbaik was awake earlier than usual, as she wished to get through her work as soon as possible, and be ready to start for a dance which was to be held some distance off.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 252960]), Text sample: She went first to the cow house, which it was her duty to keep clean, but to her amazement she found fresh straw put down, the racks filled with hay, the cows milked, and the pails standing neatly in a row.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 186720]), Text sample: To be sure, Jegu only replied roughly that he didn't know what she was talking about, but this answer made her feel all the more certain that it was he and nobody else.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 132000]), Text sample: The same thing took place every day, and never had the cow house been so clean nor the cows so fat.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 153120]), Text sample: Morning and evening Barbaik found her earthen pots full of milk and a pound of butter freshly churned, ornamented with leaves.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 122880]), Text sample: At the end of a few weeks she grew so used to this state of affairs that she only got up just in time to prepare breakfast.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 354960]), Text sample: Soon even this grew to be unnecessary, for a day arrived when, coming downstairs, she discovered that the house was swept, the furniture polished, the fire lit, and the food ready, so that she had nothing to do except to ring the great bell which summoned the labourers from the fields to come and eat it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 205680]), Text sample: This, also, she thought was the work of Jegu, and she could not help feeling that a husband of this sort would be very useful to a girl who liked to lie in bed and to amuse herself.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 84480]), Text sample: Indeed, Barbaik had only to express a wish for it to be satisfied.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 384960]), Text sample: If the wind was cold or the sun was hot and she was afraid to go out lest her complexion should be spoilt, she need only to run down to the spring close by and say softly, 'I should like my churns to be full, and my wet linen to be stretched on the hedge to dry,' and she need never give another thought to the matter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 126960]), Text sample: And she believed that all this was owing to Jegu, and she could no longer do without him, even in her thoughts.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 202560]), Text sample: She would wear the beautiful dresses that came when she wished for them, and visit her neighbours, who would be dying of envy all the while, and she would be able to dance as much as she wished.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89520]), Text sample: Jegu would always be there to work for her and save for her, and watch over her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 115200]), Text sample: The marriage took place the following month, and a few days later the old man died quite suddenly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 140400]), Text sample: Now Jegu had everything to see to himself, and somehow it did not seem so easy as when the farmer was alive.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72960]), Text sample: And all the payment the brownie ever asked for was a bowl of broth.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 178320]), Text sample: From the very day of her marriage Barbaik had noted with surprise and rage that things ceased to be done for her as they had been done all the weeks and months before.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 125520]), Text sample: She complained to Jegu of his laziness, and he only stared at her, not understanding what she was talking about.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32160]), Text sample: Barbaik was furious.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 136798]), Text sample: But when she looked at Jegu and beheld his red face, squinting eyes, and untidy hair, her anger was doubled.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 76801]), Text sample: While now I can receive no presents except from my husband.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82560]), Text sample: Oh, you wretched dwarf, I will never, never forgive you!'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 135841]), Text sample: To her great joy he consented, bidding her set out for the city of the dwarfs and to tell them exactly what she wanted.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56401]), Text sample: Full of excitement, Barbaik started on her journey.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 175200]), Text sample: It was not long, and when she reached the town she went straight to the dwarfs, who were holding counsel in a wide green place, and said to them, 'Listen, my friends!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 133440]), Text sample: She had hardly spoken when the horse appeared, and mounting on his back she started for the village where the wedding was to be held.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65279]), Text sample: At length she caught some words uttered by one man to another.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 95521]), Text sample: 'Why, the farmer's wife has sold her horse's tail!' and turned in her saddle.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 21359]), Text sample: Yes; it was true.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 31680]), Text sample: Her horse had no tail!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 97199]), Text sample: She had forgotten to ask for one, and the wicked dwarfs had carried out her orders to the letter!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 134161]), Text sample: But it was of no use; he declined to move out of a walk; and she was forced to hear all the jokes that were made upon her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 204479]), Text sample: In the evening she returned to the farm more angry than ever, and quite determined to revenge herself on the brownie whenever she had the chance, which happened to be very soon.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 245520]), Text sample: It was the spring, and just the time of year when the dwarfs held their fete, so one day the brownie asked Jegu if he might bring his friends to have supper in the great barn, and whether he would allow them to dance there.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 290159]), Text sample: Of course, Jegu was only too pleased to be able to do anything for the brownie, and he ordered Barbaik to spread her best table cloths in the barn, and to make a quantity of little loaves and pancakes, and, besides, to keep all the milk given by the cows that morning.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 181440]), Text sample: But in a moment they all sprang up with a cry, and ran away screaming, for Barbaik had placed pans of hot coals under their feet, and all their poor little toes were burnt.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 188160]), Text sample: 'You won't forget that in a hurry,' she said, smiling grimly to herself, but in a moment they were back again with large pots of water, which they poured on the fire.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60960]), Text sample: Then they joined hands and danced round it, singing:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34800]), Text sample: Before them is a clear road.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 104160]), Text sample: Not to happiness, as they may believe, but to the opportunity for gaining happiness.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 248640]), Text sample: The goal is not easily won, but they can attain it without the aid of luck or rare gifts or miracles-simply by practicing the common everyday virtues that bring success in all human ventures.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 241920]), Text sample: A young couple's engagement period is like any other time of excited anticipation, when one has received the promise of something greatly desired, but must wait awhile before its delivery.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 216720]), Text sample: The happiness of the waiting period is characterized by the absence of a critical spirit, and therefore is apt to be thought of as an experience of pure delight.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 194160]), Text sample: But the first days of marriage bring out a different set of feelings-those that come when one has definitely obtained possession of anything that before was only promised.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 97920]), Text sample: At first the emotions seem to stand still-this is the long coveted moment!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 40800]), Text sample: Then one begins to appraise.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 84960]), Text sample: Is the object of one's wishes as desirable as one had expected?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 235200]), Text sample: Because reality rarely measures up to imagination, the first answer is almost bound to be, "No, this is not what I expected." And the first emotion tends to be disappointment.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 525840]), Text sample: If one accepts the fact that discrepancy between imagination and reality is inevitable, he is better able to go on to a more thorough examination of the situation, from the fresh viewpoint of finding out just what he has received, regardless of hazy but optimistic expectations; and the object possessed will more than likely turn out to be better than, although different from, what the imagination pictured.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 224160]), Text sample: Knowing that a fleeting sense of disappointment is not peculiar to one's own marriage, but likely to occur in all, as in every other human undertaking, takes away its power to hurt.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 239040]), Text sample: Unworried by any fear of calamity, each marriage partner can turn to account his or her powers of discernment by learning to recognize the assets as well as the liabilities of the partnership.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 159360]), Text sample: Roughly, both the helps and the hindrances to married happiness can be lumped under one word-personalities.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 259920]), Text sample: Temperament, mannerisms, tastes-all that is implied in the distinct individuality of each person-make up the chief source of the advantages and disadvantages with which the couple enter marriage.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44400]), Text sample: These traits cannot be changed overnight.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 199920]), Text sample: Nor is it necessary, or at all wise, that they should be. john attracts Mary, and she appeals to him, because the personality of each one is what it is.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 88080]), Text sample: Love has grown up between the two as a result of this personality attraction.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 107520]), Text sample: And love is the motive that will make both try to keep open the pathway to marriage success.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 126240]), Text sample: But love is not a finished product that, once it comes, can forever after be trusted to keep its strength.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 122400]), Text sample: Like everything else that is alive, it must be kept growing through exercise, or it wastes away.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 100800]), Text sample: Love gives the push that keeps a marriage moving, but it does not give the direction.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 59040]), Text sample: That comes from understanding and cooperation.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 36240]), Text sample: This is what they must guard against.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 110400]), Text sample: While love is still the moving force of their lives, they must study the problems that are due to come.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65040]), Text sample: To wait until they are beset by them is to beg for trouble.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 134400]), Text sample: And finally, they must know what constitutes a happy marriage-what to aim for in their day to day association.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43440]), Text sample: What makes a successful marriage?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 76560]), Text sample: Here are nine guideposts to help john and Mary along their road:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 388800]), Text sample: The smaller issues on which this rests are the lively clashes of opposite desires, inevitable in the coming together of any two persons, intensified when those two persons are as different as a man and a woman, and unavoidable for two committed to a lifetime together in the close quarters of marriage.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 128880]), Text sample: Decisions must be made on the basis of what is good for both, not the selfish or narrow wish of either.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 135840]), Text sample: The choice that brings the larger advantage to the two persons in their common role of marriage partners is the one to be made.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 113760]), Text sample: For example, Mary wants to buy a car, just as john is reckoning that the time has come to build a house.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 148560]), Text sample: Or perhaps he wants to invest money in professional or business advancement at the precise moment when she realizes she wants a child.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 187920]), Text sample: Nor could he, overruling her against her will, find in his choice of home owning or personal career investment the satisfaction he had expected.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 88800]), Text sample: They two, and nobody else, can make the decision to fit their marriage.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 217200]), Text sample: If each one is hurt at the other's inability to join instantly in his, or her, plans, they will need to take pains not to get sidetracked into making a personal contest of the affair.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 310560]), Text sample: Trying to win over your partner with a single eye to getting what you want, regardless of its effect on the mate, is short sighted in the extreme. Even if you could care only for personal pleasure, that cannot long outlast your spouse's displeasure.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 193920]), Text sample: Staging a contest or a succession of small contests, for the sake of finding out who is boss builds up a habit of fighting that may lead to a bitter end.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 80160]), Text sample: It is useless to discover who can win in any particular skirmish.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 192720]), Text sample: What is important is to learn whether one of you is set on being "head of the house." If your spouse craves that distinction, by all means hand it over without delay.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 149040]), Text sample: It is an empty honor, for the one who bends but does not break will readily develop the fine art of influencing the headstrong one.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 159120]), Text sample: Because it is part of the traditional feminine character to enjoy giving in to the man, this tendency must be scrutinized when it appears.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 193440]), Text sample: A woman's feeling that she will be emotionally gratified by making a sacrifice does not prove that, aside from her momentary pleasure, there is any value in it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147120]), Text sample: The ease or difficulty with which husband or wife makes an adjustment in no way measures the worth of that adjustment for their partnership.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 222720]), Text sample: Because of women's recent growth in socially recognized independence, any individual woman may waver between a craving for self sacrifice and a repugnance to the very thought of it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 95520]), Text sample: This changeableness can make her feel resentful after she has given in to her husband.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68160]), Text sample: All this must be taken into account in making decisions.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65520]), Text sample: Compromise, not submission, should be the rule.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 130080]), Text sample: If john forges ahead on one count, Mary must find an acceptable outlet for herself on some other front.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89279]), Text sample: Respect for the other member of the marriage association is a must have.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 312481]), Text sample: Nobody can suddenly change his personality at will, and the effort to do so to please the partner is liable to result in a topheavy hypocrisy-a superstructure calculated to impress the observer, but built on a shaky foundation of chaos.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 165360]), Text sample: The changes a husband or wife makes in the partner's total personality are in the nature of altered emphasis in the expression of traits already present.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 190079]), Text sample: These minor changes occur as by products of active response to the personality of the mate in many small daily contacts, and not as a result of exhortation.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 224160]), Text sample: Nor are they necessarily permanent. A chameleon changes color easily to match its environment or temper of the moment, but a human being's more lasting change is not so readily made.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 106319]), Text sample: Each marriage partner must be proud of the other and let the other continue to be proud of him or her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 87361]), Text sample: Therefore you have to respect yourself and act as if you did, even at home.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78960]), Text sample: Too many couples exploit the sense of let down that marriage brings with it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 122399]), Text sample: After so long a time, husband and wife cease to feel that they must exert themselves for each other in little matters.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 143519]), Text sample: Knowing themselves accepted, they lounge-mentally, mannerly, and physically-when at home or elsewhere alone together.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 178079]), Text sample: Some of this relaxation is a good thing, but it is a mistake to let home and spouse degenerate into nothing more than an invitation to be lazy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 126479]), Text sample: If you are tired or irritable, you can rest or exercise for restoration, as in the days before marriage.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 118320]), Text sample: Fatigue and nervousness, expressed, breed fatigue and nervousness in a sympathetic audience.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52079]), Text sample: Too great concentration is to be avoided.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 91440]), Text sample: Even the greatest love stagnates if it is kept out of the main current of life.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 240719]), Text sample: This is why the unique value of children is their service as an entering wedge in the close grown love of husband and wife, a wedge that widens and holds forever wider the unity of love it has penetrated.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 167520]), Text sample: Other responsibilities, other interests, may serve a similar purpose, though more easily dislodged and seldom striking so deep.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 115200]), Text sample: Friends, old and new, have a function in relieving the overclose concern of one marriage partner with the other.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 190560]), Text sample: Common friends are fine, but for this purpose there is special need of friends for either spouse who can call forth those sides of his or her nature that are not aroused by the mate.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 205919]), Text sample: The factor that underlies all the perplexities, and most of the contentment, of marriage is its unique degree of concentrated intimacy. Here the supreme testing always comes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 155759]), Text sample: Each means so much to the other, each needs so much from the other, that there can be no halfway satisfaction in being together.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 93118]), Text sample: But there will come a first time when john is too tired to go out with Mary, or vice versa.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 62639]), Text sample: The wife may be alone part of the day and profit by it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65759]), Text sample: When john comes home at night, he has not had that privilege.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 98880]), Text sample: The general level of emotion is what counts, not the spectacular scaling of peaks.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 269041]), Text sample: Some husbands, some wives, are artists at achieving and momentarily living up to romantic settings, but quickly flop down to the lower levels of decent fairness between the high spots of their sentimental flare ups.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 182161]), Text sample: Others cannot utter a poetic phrase, make a romantic gesture, or let their eyes show the quick intensity of their tender emotions if they must die for it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 76801]), Text sample: This difference is one of make-up and training, not of marriage capacity.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 119521]), Text sample: Another terrible moment that is due to come may seem even more frightening because it is you who are slipping.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 98161]), Text sample: Soon or late you find that some familiar mannerism of your spouse displeases you.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 192238]), Text sample: It may be a slight uncouthness at table, a peculiar back country phrase or pronunciation, some gesture of timidity or swaggering.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41039]), Text sample: And your vexation terrifies you.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 59519]), Text sample: Does this mean that you no longer love your mate as you did?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 38642]), Text sample: You cannot help your change of feeling.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 116880]), Text sample: How, then, can you hope to keep your affection from disappearing altogether if it has already begun to wane?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 157920]), Text sample: You remember other people you once thought you loved, and wonder, panic stricken, how you can keep this love from dying as those other loves did.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 317760]), Text sample: This is probably an almost universal experience, marking, not the beginning of the end of love, but the passage from an adolescent type of blind devotion to a more mature affection that persists in spite of being able to admit the flaws it sees.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 94079]), Text sample: For the very young a person must register one hundred percent or be rejected.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 205681]), Text sample: Now that you can see your mate more clearly, you should also be able to see more accurately his, or her, good points, which before were hidden from you in the mist of your enthusiasm.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 83280]), Text sample: Your love is now becoming less self centered and more helpful to your partner.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 85440]), Text sample: There can be no holding on to the present nor seeking to bring back the past.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 29281]), Text sample: The tale is never told.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78240]), Text sample: There can be no narrowing of marriage to mere sex adjustment.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 151202]), Text sample: To interpret the marriage association as little more than sex is to throw away all chance of success, even in the realm of sex.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 270241]), Text sample: As a continuing part of this life adjustment, sex adjustment can develop into a permanent factor of married happiness; but without the larger adjustment, the partial adjustment cannot be made in any fundamental and enduring form.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 152639]), Text sample: In the sex life in marriage, as in other parts of the association, each partner wins by considering the other before the self.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 103199]), Text sample: At no point can the domination of either partner over the other take the place of adjustment.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 192721]), Text sample: One who prides himself or herself on having to be handled with gloves has a great deal of growing up to do in order to be able to be an active partner in the marriage.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 261601]), Text sample: In the healthy marriage, this sympathetic response will soon give way to anger, which in turn may have the effect of a dash of cold water in the face of the oversensitive one, helping him or her to buck up and behave like an adult.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 131039]), Text sample: In the unhealthy marriage, sympathy will grow into pity, which drives out the indispensable attitude of respect.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 219120]), Text sample: Both get hurt, but the weak person does nothing but squeal about it, while the robust ignores it except for trying to take some constructive step to prevent future occasions for hurt.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 157919]), Text sample: The marriage partner who is mature will maintain trust in the other's good intentions in the face of what might seem to be occasions for hurt feelings.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 83279]), Text sample: A chief advantage of the married estate is its opportunity for frankness.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 174481]), Text sample: "Why doesn't his wife tell him of that unpleasant mannerism, so he can correct it?" bears witness to the universal appreciation of this function of married life.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 273360]), Text sample: But if john nurses hurt feelings whenever Mary punctures his vanity by suggesting that he presents to the world a less than perfect front, Mary may soon lose courage and relinquish her wifely job of husband improvement.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48720]), Text sample: Frankness must go clothed in tact.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 100081]), Text sample: Stiff minded people who are frank only when angry lose their case before they present it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 167520]), Text sample: If the expression of anger is to have its proper stimulative effect, it has to be administered but rarely, and then in small doses.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 189120]), Text sample: More has a paralyzing effect on the recipient, producing a response in kind that takes away the ability to think of anything except retaliation.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 117841]), Text sample: We are all immature at some points, but we can welcome opportunities for growth, painful though they may be.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 91919]), Text sample: As this is an impossibility, they are aware of increasing dissatisfaction.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54000]), Text sample: That does not mean they are unadapted to each other.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24960]), Text sample: No, they hadn't.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 145920]), Text sample: It was wet and besmirched with mud, and, in fact was lying half in and half out of a little puddle of water when it was found.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37200]), Text sample: But in this they were disappointed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41040]), Text sample: Of this there was no doubt whatever.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39600]), Text sample: Here was a deepening of the mystery.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 110880]), Text sample: Squire Harrington was especially active, and left no stone unturned to unravel the mystery.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 119280]), Text sample: Lapierre gave up all his time to the search, and left the Royal Oak to the care of its landlady.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 304080]), Text sample: Every place, likely and unlikely, where a man's body might possibly lie concealed; every tract of bush and woodland; every barn and out building; every hollow and ditch; every field and fence corner, was explored with careful minuteness.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 136560]), Text sample: Doctor Scott, the local coroner, held himself in readiness to summon a coroner's jury at the shortest notice.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24480]), Text sample: All to no purpose.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64800]), Text sample: He lay there still shivering, beneath the heavy blankets.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 114000]), Text sample: "I don't dare!" He echoed Graham's words. "There's nothing else any one can say.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 31920]), Text sample: I must decide what to do.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24480]), Text sample: I must think it over."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64800]), Text sample: But, as always, thought brought no release.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66480]), Text sample: It merely insisted that the case against him was proved.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 70560]), Text sample: After this something must be done about Paredes's detention.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 62640]), Text sample: He raised himself on his elbow and glanced from the window.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 153120]), Text sample: Two burly fellows in overalls, carrying pick and spade across their shoulders, pushed through the underbrush at the edge of the clearing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 17040]), Text sample: He turned.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64080]), Text sample: Graham, fully dressed, stood at the side of the bed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42720]), Text sample: "Those men?" Bobby asked wearily.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39840]), Text sample: "The grave diggers," Graham answered.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 36720]), Text sample: That's why I've come to wake you up.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 40800]), Text sample: The minister's telephoned Katherine.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 29280]), Text sample: He will be here before noon.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33600]), Text sample: Do you know it's after ten o'clock?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 86640]), Text sample: For some time Bobby stared through the window at the desolate, ragged landscape.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54960]), Text sample: It was abnormally cold even for the late fall.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 88800]), Text sample: Dull clouds obscured the sun and furnished an illusion of crowding earthward.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23520]), Text sample: "A funereal day."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 100080]), Text sample: "When your grandfather's buried," Graham answered softly, "we'll all feel happier."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 30960]), Text sample: "Why?" Bobby asked.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39600]), Text sample: "It won't lessen the fact of his murder."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 103920]), Text sample: "Time," Graham said, "lessens such facts-even for the police."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35280]), Text sample: Bobby glanced at him, flushing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 21600]), Text sample: Graham smiled.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35280]), Text sample: I slept like a top last night.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 18480]), Text sample: I saw nothing."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 21600]), Text sample: Graham frowned.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46320]), Text sample: "He shouldn't be in jail," Bobby persisted.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 30960]), Text sample: "Get up," Graham advised.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 38880]), Text sample: As far as possible you must."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 27120]), Text sample: Bobby sprang upright.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 25440]), Text sample: "How can I forget it?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67680]), Text sample: If it was hard to face sleep before, what do you think it is now?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 25440]), Text sample: "Don't," Graham said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 129120]), Text sample: When Bobby had bathed and dressed he found, in spite of his mental turmoil, that his sleep had done him good.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60240]), Text sample: "The manager took my advice, but Maria's still missing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39840]), Text sample: Her pictures are in most of the papers.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 38160]), Text sample: "Where's Robinson?" Bobby asked.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 36960]), Text sample: "He learned nothing new last night?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 18720]), Text sample: I gather not."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23040]), Text sample: Bobby looked up.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 61440]), Text sample: "Isn't that an automobile coming through the woods?" he asked.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44160]), Text sample: The car stopped at the entrance of the court.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54960]), Text sample: They heard the remote tinkling of the front door bell.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 26400]), Text sample: Jenkins passed through.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 226800]), Text sample: The cold air invading the hall and the dining room told them he had opened the door. His sharp exclamation recalled Howells's report which, at their direction, he had failed to mail.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51840]), Text sample: Had his exclamation been drawn by an accuser?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 30720]), Text sample: Bobby started to rise.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 30960]), Text sample: Graham moved toward the door.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53520]), Text sample: He appeared, moreover, to have slept pleasantly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 16560]), Text sample: "Good morning.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49920]), Text sample: I've nearly frozen driving from Smithtown."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 73200]), Text sample: Before either man could grope for a suitable greeting he faced Bobby.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 59040]), Text sample: "Fact is, Bobby, I left New York too suddenly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 18720]), Text sample: I thought you were-"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63120]), Text sample: Graham interrupted with a flat demand for an explanation.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24240]), Text sample: "How did you get away?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 25920]), Text sample: "Later, mr Graham.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68640]), Text sample: There is a hack driver outside who is even more suspicious than you.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24960]), Text sample: He wants to be paid.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 123840]), Text sample: I asked Rawlins to drive me back, but he rushed from the courthouse, probably to telephone his rotund superior.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 79440]), Text sample: Fact is, this fellow wants five dollars-an outrageous rate.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 13920]), Text sample: Thanks."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47040]), Text sample: He surveyed the remains of Bobby's breakfast.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57120]), Text sample: Bobby tried to account for Paredes's friendly manner.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44880]), Text sample: Only one theory promised to fit at all.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72720]), Text sample: It was necessary for the Panamanian to return to the Cedars.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 124800]), Text sample: His purpose, whatever it was, compelled him to remain for the present in the mournful, tragic house.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66720]), Text sample: Therefore, he would crush his justifiable anger.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 79680]), Text sample: He would make it practically impossible for Bobby to refuse his hospitality.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 179760]), Text sample: Paredes's arrival possessed one virtue: It diverted Bobby's thoughts temporarily from his own dilemma, from his inability to chart a course.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 50400]), Text sample: Graham, on the other hand, was ill at ease.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 75360]), Text sample: For him yesterday's incident was not so lightly to be passed over.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47520]), Text sample: Eventually his curiosity conquered.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63840]), Text sample: The words came, nevertheless, with some difficulty:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37440]), Text sample: "We scarcely expected you back."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33600]), Text sample: His laugh was short and embarrassed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 28560]), Text sample: "Splendid coffee!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39600]), Text sample: You should have tasted what I had this morning.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 31200]), Text sample: Simple enough, mr Graham.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56400]), Text sample: I telephoned as soon as Rawlins got me to the Bastille.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35280]), Text sample: He planned it with some local fellow.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 92640]), Text sample: He fixed a pretty stiff bail, but the local lawyer was there with a bondsman, and I came back.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20160]), Text sample: My clothes are here.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 27600]), Text sample: You don't mind, Bobby?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 94560]), Text sample: That moment in the hall when Graham had awakened him urged Bobby to reply with a genuine warmth:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23280]), Text sample: I'm glad you're out of it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57600]), Text sample: Your presence in the private staircase was the last straw.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34560]), Text sample: You will forgive us, Carlos?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 50400]), Text sample: He put down his coffee cup and lighted a cigarette.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44160]), Text sample: He smoked with a vast contentment.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20160]), Text sample: "That's better.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 30720]), Text sample: Nothing to forgive, Bobby.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 36720]), Text sample: Let us call it a misunderstanding."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 25920]), Text sample: Graham moved closer.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54479]), Text sample: His eyes still smiled, but his voice was harder:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35760]), Text sample: "Bygones are bygones.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41762]), Text sample: "Since you wish it," Bobby said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82560]), Text sample: But more important than the knowledge Graham desired, loomed the old question.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 26880]), Text sample: What was the man's game?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23760]), Text sample: Robinson entered.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32639]), Text sample: Clearly he had slept little.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37681]), Text sample: "I saw you arrive," he said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 132479]), Text sample: "Since the law won't hold me at your convenience in Smithtown I keep myself at your service here-if Bobby permits it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23041]), Text sample: Could you ask more?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 100800]), Text sample: That fleeting, satanic impression of yesterday came back, sharper, more alarming.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 225840]), Text sample: His reserve and easy daring mastered them all; and always, as now, he laughed at the futility of their efforts to sound his purposes, to limit his freedom of action.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 105599]), Text sample: Bobby didn't care to meet the uncommunicative eyes whose depths he had never been able to explore.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 173521]), Text sample: Was there a special power there that could control the destinies of other people, that might make men walk unconsciously to accomplish the ends of an unscrupulous brain?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68399]), Text sample: The district attorney appeared as much at sea as the others.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 71760]), Text sample: "You've no objection to the gentleman visiting you for the present?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44640]), Text sample: "I've been watching the preparations out there.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 116880]), Text sample: "I suppose not," Robinson sneered, "since everybody knows well enough what's in it."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 55678]), Text sample: "You'll be at the grave-as chief mourner?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32161]), Text sample: Bobby walked from the room.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54960]), Text sample: He put on his coat and hat and left the house.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 70081]), Text sample: But almost immediately even that prophylactic was denied him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 115440]), Text sample: With his direction a matter of indifference, chance led him into the thicket at the side of the house.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39599]), Text sample: He had walked some distance.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 279121]), Text sample: The underbrush had long interposed a veil between him and the Cedars above whose roofs smoke wreathed in the still air like fantastic figures weaving a shroud to lower over the time stained, melancholy walls.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 138720]), Text sample: For once he was grateful to the forest because it had forbidden him to glance perpetually back at that dismal and pensive picture.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 223202]), Text sample: Then he became aware of twigs hastily lopped off, of bushes bent and torn, of the uncovering, through these careless means, of an old path.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 31920]), Text sample: He paused, listening.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 111600]), Text sample: The labour of the men was given an uncouth rhythm by their grunting expulsions of breath.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 151440]), Text sample: Otherwise the nature of their industry and its surroundings had imposed upon them a silence, in itself beast like and unnatural.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63121]), Text sample: Its brevity pointed the previous dumbness of the speaker:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 17519]), Text sample: "Deep enough!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 109440]), Text sample: He could see where the men had had to tear bushes from among the graves in order to insert their tools.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 76319]), Text sample: There was an ironical justice in the condition of the old cemetery.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 118798]), Text sample: Like everything about the Cedars, Silas Blackburn had delivered it to the swift, obliterating fingers of time.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 131760]), Text sample: This necessary task on which Bobby had stumbled had made the thicket less congenial than the house.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 91199]), Text sample: As he walked back he forecasted with a keen apprehension his approaching ordeal.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 136801]), Text sample: It would, doubtless, be more difficult to endure than Howells's experiment over Silas Blackburn's body in the old room.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 268560]), Text sample: Could he witness the definite imprisonment of his grandfather in a narrow box; could he watch the covering earth fall noisily in that bleak place of silence without displaying for Robinson the guilt that impressed him more and more?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 77040]), Text sample: A strange man appeared, walking from the direction of the house.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 221039]), Text sample: His black clothing, relieved only by narrow edges of white cuffs between the sleeves and the heavy mourning gloves, fitted with solemn harmony into the landscape and Bobby's mood.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66481]), Text sample: He was glad to see Graham leave the court and hurry toward him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42000]), Text sample: "I was coming to hunt you up, Bobby.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 26400]), Text sample: The minister's arrived.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 25681]), Text sample: So has Doctor Groom.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 26640]), Text sample: Everything's about ready."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 17760]), Text sample: "Doctor Groom?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33121]), Text sample: Bobby agreed indifferently.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46079]), Text sample: They walked slowly back to the house.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 81120]), Text sample: Graham made it plain that his mind was far from the sad business ahead.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 38880]), Text sample: "He ignores what happened yesterday.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42480]), Text sample: He settles himself in the Cedars again."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49440]), Text sample: "I don't know what to think of it," Bobby answered.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49440]), Text sample: "This morning Carlos gave me the creeps."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 28801]), Text sample: "Gave me the creeps, too.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 95519]), Text sample: He suggests resources as hard to understand as anything that has happened in the old room.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 111121]), Text sample: You'll confess, Bobby, he's had a good deal of influence over you-an influence for evil?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54720]), Text sample: "I won't blame Carlos for that," Bobby muttered.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46798]), Text sample: "Maria did her share," Bobby said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35519]), Text sample: He broke off, looking at Graham.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24960]), Text sample: "What are you driving at?"

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 149041]), Text sample: Excuse me, excuse me, but I owe this money to the charity fund,--a deposit which I promised to pay this morning."

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 169919]), Text sample: "Certainly, I excuse you," said Monte Cristo graciously, "and pocket them." And he placed the bonds in his pocket book.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 110401]), Text sample: "But," said Danglars, "there is still a sum of one hundred thousand francs?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 98880]), Text sample: "The balance would come to about that sum; but keep it, and we shall be quits."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 104400]), Text sample: At the door he found his carriage, and was immediately driven to the bank.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 196560]), Text sample: My funds are deposited there, and you can understand that if I draw out ten millions on the same day it will appear rather strange to the governor.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 71762]), Text sample: Two days will be a different thing," said Danglars, smiling.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34318]), Text sample: "Thank you, no, sir."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 29759]), Text sample: "Then it will be to morrow."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34801]), Text sample: "Yes; but without fail."

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 12959]), Text sample: What?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51359]), Text sample: That must have been One Hundred and Twelfth back there.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 111599]), Text sample: Apartments along here expensive-probably hundred and fifty a month-maybe two hundred.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 173279]), Text sample: What a dirty river-want to go down there and see if it's dirty-French rivers all brown or black, so were Southern rivers.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78240]), Text sample: No desire to sleep with Jill, what could Alec see in her?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47039]), Text sample: Alec had a coarse taste in women.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 189120]), Text sample: Own taste the best; Isabelle, Clara, Rosalind, Eleanor, were all American. Eleanor would pitch, probably southpaw.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 106801]), Text sample: Rosalind was outfield, wonderful hitter, Clara first base, maybe.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35041]), Text sample: Where's the darned bell-

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 118320]), Text sample: There, an opening made for the purpose gave them access to the aluminum car.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 264240]), Text sample: Nicholl, once introduced with his companions inside the projectile, began to close the opening by means of a strong plate, held in position by powerful screws.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 265440]), Text sample: Other plates, closely fitted, covered the lenticular glasses, and the travelers, hermetically enclosed in their metal prison, were plunged in profound darkness.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 61200]), Text sample: And first let us try and see a little.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 517680]), Text sample: So saying, the thoughtless fellow lit a match by striking it on the sole of his boot; and approached the burner fixed to the receptacle, in which the carbonized hydrogen, stored at high pressure, sufficed for the lighting and warming of the projectile for a hundred and forty four hours, or six days and six nights.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 294480]), Text sample: The gas caught fire, and thus lighted the projectile looked like a comfortable room with thickly padded walls, furnished with a circular divan, and a roof rounded in the shape of a dome.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 259680]), Text sample: "It is a prison," said he, "but a traveling prison; and, with the right of putting my nose to the window, I could well stand a lease of a hundred years.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 138240]), Text sample: While Michel Ardan was speaking, Barbicane and Nicholl were making their last preparations.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 330240]), Text sample: Nicholl's chronometer marked twenty minutes past ten p m when the three travelers were finally enclosed in their projectile. This chronometer was set within the tenth of a second by that of Murchison the engineer.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 36720]), Text sample: Barbicane consulted it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 303840]), Text sample: At forty seven minutes past ten Murchison will launch the electric spark on the wire which communicates with the charge of the Columbiad. At that precise moment we shall leave our spheroid.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 110400]), Text sample: Thus we still have twenty seven minutes to remain on the earth."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 160800]), Text sample: "Well!" exclaimed Michel Ardan, in a good humored tone, "much may be done in twenty six minutes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 280560]), Text sample: The gravest questions of morals and politics may be discussed, and even solved. Twenty six minutes well employed are worth more than twenty six years in which nothing is done.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 107520]), Text sample: "And you conclude, then, you everlasting talker?" asked Barbicane.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51840]), Text sample: "Twenty four only," said Nicholl.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 169920]), Text sample: "Well, twenty four, if you like, my noble captain," said Ardan; "twenty four minutes in which to investigate----"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 273360]), Text sample: "Michel," said Barbicane, "during the passage we shall have plenty of time to investigate the most difficult questions. For the present we must occupy ourselves with our departure."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 152640]), Text sample: "Doubtless; but there are still some precautions to be taken, to deaden as much as possible the first shock."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 168000]), Text sample: "Have we not the water cushions placed between the partition breaks, whose elasticity will sufficiently protect us?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 123600]), Text sample: "I hope so, Michel," replied Barbicane gently, "but I am not sure."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 180960]), Text sample: "He hopes!--He is not sure!-- and he waits for the moment when we are encased to make this deplorable admission!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41520]), Text sample: I beg to be allowed to get out!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54240]), Text sample: "And how?" asked Barbicane.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35520]), Text sample: "Twenty," said Nicholl.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 180960]), Text sample: For some moments the three travelers looked at each other. Then they began to examine the objects imprisoned with them.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 324960]), Text sample: "We have now to decide how we can best place ourselves to resist the shock. Position cannot be an indifferent matter; and we must, as much as possible, prevent the rush of blood to the head."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41760]), Text sample: "Just so," said Nicholl.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 166320]), Text sample: "No," said Barbicane, "let us stretch ourselves on our sides; we shall resist the shock better that way.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 192240]), Text sample: Remember that, when the projectile starts, it matters little whether we are in it or before it; it amounts to much the same thing."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90480]), Text sample: "Do you approve of my idea, Nicholl?" asked Barbicane.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51120]), Text sample: "Entirely," replied the captain.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58320]), Text sample: "We've still thirteen minutes and a half."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 192960]), Text sample: "That Nicholl is not a man," exclaimed Michel; "he is a chronometer with seconds, an escape, and eight holes."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 157680]), Text sample: But his companions were not listening; they were taking up their last positions with the most perfect coolness.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 153840]), Text sample: They were like two methodical travelers in a car, seeking to place themselves as comfortably as possible.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 229200]), Text sample: We might well ask ourselves of what materials are the hearts of these Americans made, to whom the approach of the most frightful danger added no pulsation.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 121200]), Text sample: Three thick and solidly made couches had been placed in the projectile.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 107280]), Text sample: Nicholl and Barbicane placed them in the center of the disc forming the floor.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 116880]), Text sample: There the three travelers were to stretch themselves some moments before their departure.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 438720]), Text sample: During this time, Ardan, not being able to keep still, turned in his narrow prison like a wild beast in a cage, chatting with his friends, speaking to the dogs Diana and Satellite, to whom, as may be seen, he had given significant names.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34560]), Text sample: "Ah, Diana!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 220801]), Text sample: Ah, Satellite!" he exclaimed, teasing them; "so you are going to show the moon dogs the good habits of the dogs of the earth!

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 171359]), Text sample: "There are," said Michel Ardan, "just as there are horses, cows, donkeys, and chickens.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53280]), Text sample: I bet that we shall find chickens."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 80880]), Text sample: "A hundred dollars we shall find none!" said Nicholl.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 561840]), Text sample: "Done, my captain!" replied Ardan, clasping Nicholl's hand. "But, by the bye, you have already lost three bets with our president, as the necessary funds for the enterprise have been found, as the operation of casting has been successful, and lastly, as the Columbiad has been loaded without accident, six thousand dollars."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35519]), Text sample: "Yes," replied Nicholl.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 76079]), Text sample: "Thirty seven minutes six seconds past ten."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35039]), Text sample: "It is understood, captain.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 356399]), Text sample: Well, before another quarter of an hour you will have to count nine thousand dollars to the president; four thousand because the Columbiad will not burst, and five thousand because the projectile will rise more than six miles in the air."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56880]), Text sample: "I only ask to be allowed to pay."

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 229920]), Text sample: I see that you are a man of method, which I could never be; but indeed you have made a series of bets of very little advantage to yourself, allow me to tell you."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45841]), Text sample: "And why?" asked Nicholl.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 210721]), Text sample: "Because, if you gain the first, the Columbiad will have burst, and the projectile with it; and Barbicane will no longer be there to reimburse your dollars."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 194400]), Text sample: "My stake is deposited at the bank in Baltimore," replied Barbicane simply; "and if Nicholl is not there, it will go to his heirs."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63360]), Text sample: "Forty two minutes past ten!" said Nicholl.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 492238]), Text sample: "Yes, five little minutes!" replied Michel Ardan; "and we are enclosed in a projectile, at the bottom of a gun nine hundred feet long!

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 341760]), Text sample: And friend Murchison, with his chronometer in hand, his eye fixed on the needle, his finger on the electric apparatus, is counting the seconds preparatory to launching us into interplanetary space."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 124319]), Text sample: "Enough, Michel, enough!" said Barbicane, in a serious voice; "let us prepare.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 98640]), Text sample: A few instants alone separate us from an eventful moment.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 83040]), Text sample: "Forty seven minutes past ten!" murmured the captain.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 328560]), Text sample: "Twenty seconds more!" Barbicane quickly put out the gas and lay down by his companions, and the profound silence was only broken by the ticking of the chronometer marking the seconds.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 309120]), Text sample: Suddenly a dreadful shock was felt, and the projectile, under the force of six billions of litres of gas, developed by the combustion of pyroxyle, mounted into space.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 301200]), Text sample: Strange as it may seem, this sphere, which for convenience we will call Brief, revolves very slowly on its axis, so that our world makes fifteen times as many revolutions as this planet.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 126480]), Text sample: It appears that on all worlds everything is regulated in accordance with the length of human life.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 360240]), Text sample: Furrows of care and trouble begin to deepen on the faces of these Briefites as they approach an age of what we would call three years, and if by lease of strength they pass on toward an age of four years, it is but an evidence of their exceptional vitality.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 18000]), Text sample: JOURNALISM.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 326160]), Text sample: Things happen in such quick succession that the news is hustled out at all hours of the day and night; not on sheets of paper, but through automatic news receivers, machines somewhat akin to our telegraph instruments.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 80640]), Text sample: But compared to our customs, the news is very scarce.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 112800]), Text sample: There being no competition, no time or space is required for sensational trash.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89520]), Text sample: Thus, if nothing of importance occurs, nothing need be transmitted.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 242160]), Text sample: There are indeed some advantages in the government being in constant touch with each home under its care. The advertising department pays nearly all expenses of this whole system of journalism.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 379920]), Text sample: If one of the Briefites were to step upon the shores of our rugged Earth and see the cotton or wool and leather that lies around our feet, it would appear to him as the most ridiculous thing imaginable, and no doubt his shapely feet of ivory cast would be of more than passing interest to us.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 22080]), Text sample: THEIR RAIMENT.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56160]), Text sample: Their raiment is altogether after new models.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 247920]), Text sample: Suffice it to say that a person, in lightning rapidity of motion, rushes from a store, springs upon a passing seat and is hurled away by the power of an overhead cable system.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 128640]), Text sample: I have no words of praise for this system, although the Briefites can cover considerable territory in an hour.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 156480]), Text sample: They look upon this gravity system as a wonderful achievement, for it has not been in operation for more than three hundred years.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56160]), Text sample: The power of steam has never been utilized.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 240000]), Text sample: But they have discovered what we would call gaseous oil, and have learned to put it to work, so that it is the main force employed in hoisting and all other purposes where power is required.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 240240]), Text sample: Nothing like a traveling locomotive has ever been made, although I learned that a bright wizard was experimenting and that he prophesied great changes when his gas propelled vehicle was perfected.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 212161]), Text sample: Quadrupeds that take the place of our horses are used for drayage, although nothing except the two wheeled class of vehicles was ever used until some eighty seven years ago.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 102721]), Text sample: The name of their Redeemer, phonetically rendered, is Kerm Cher.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 140880]), Text sample: The most faithful translation of this word into our language would be God affluence.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 120959]), Text sample: Similar to Christ, he confirmed his identity by unanswerable miracles.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 143281]), Text sample: Many, however, disbelieved in Kerm Cher, and held to the old axiomatic truths.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 153359]), Text sample: Thus creeds were prevalent and they remain until now, only there is much less variety than is found amongst us.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147840]), Text sample: Moisture from the night's rain hung on the tree leaves, clung in globules to Rynch's sweating body.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 132240]), Text sample: He lay on a wide branch trying to control the heavy panting which supplied his laboring lungs.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 212160]), Text sample: And he could still hear the echoes of the startled cries which had come from the men who had threaded through the woods to the up pointed tail fins of the L B.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63840]), Text sample: Now he tried to reason why he had run.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 172800]), Text sample: They were his own kind, they would take him out of the loneliness of a world heretofore empty of his species.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 137760]), Text sample: But that tall man-the one who had led the party into the irregular clearing about the life boat-
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 114000]), Text sample: Rynch shivered, dug his nails into the wood on which he lay.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 176400]), Text sample: At the sight of that man, dream and reality had crashed together, sending him into panic stricken flight.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89520]), Text sample: That was the man from the room-the man with the cup!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 86880]), Text sample: As his heart quieted he began to think more coherently.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147840]), Text sample: Then the marks on the ground at the point from which he had fallen and the L B were here, just as he remembered.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 273840]), Text sample: But not far from the small ship he had discovered something more-a campsite with a shelter fashioned out of spalls and vines, containing possessions a castaway might have accumulated.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 111360]), Text sample: That man would come, Rynch was sure of that, but he was too spent to struggle on.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90720]), Text sample: No, the answer to every part of the puzzle lay with that man.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 194400]), Text sample: To go back to the ship clearing was to risk capture-but he had to know. Rynch looked with more attention at his present surroundings.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 69840]), Text sample: Deep mold under the trees here would hold tracks.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46800]), Text sample: There might just be another way to move.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65520]), Text sample: He eyed the spread of limbs on a neighbor tree.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 158880]), Text sample: His journey through those heights was awkward and he sweated and cringed when he disturbed vocal treetop dwellers.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 127920]), Text sample: He was also to discover that close to the site of the L B crash others waited.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 148560]), Text sample: He huddled against the bole of a tree when he made out the curve of a round bulk holding tight to the tree trunk aloft.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 226080]), Text sample: Though it was balled in upon itself he was sure the creature was fully as large as he, and the menacing claws suggested it was a formidable opponent.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 222000]), Text sample: When it made no move to follow him Rynch began to hope it had only been defending its own hiding place, for its present attitude suggested concealment.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 377520]), Text sample: Still facing that featureless blob in the tree, the man retreated, alert for the first sign of advance on the part of the creature above. None came, and he dared to slip around the bole of the tree under which he stood, listening intently for any corresponding movement overhead.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 55440]), Text sample: Now he was facing that survivor's camp.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 145920]), Text sample: Another object crouched in the dark of the lean to shelter, just as its fellow was on sentry duty in the tree!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82800]), Text sample: Only this one did not have the self color of the foliage to disguise it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 111840]), Text sample: Dark pits for eyes showed no pupil, iris, or cornea.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 149040]), Text sample: The nose was a black, perfectly rounded tube jutting an inch or so beyond the cheek surface.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 110160]), Text sample: Grotesque, alien and terrifying, it made no hostile move.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 105600]), Text sample: And, since it had not turned its head, he could not be sure it had even sighted him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 71280]), Text sample: And was waiting-for what?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147120]), Text sample: He withdrew farther into the wood, intent upon finding a detour which would bring him out into the open lands.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 134640]), Text sample: Now he wanted to join forces with his own kind, whether those men were potential enemies or not.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 213840]), Text sample: As time passed the beasts closed about the clearing of the camp. Afternoon was fading into evening when he reached a point several miles downstream near the river.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 108240]), Text sample: He hoped they did not willingly venture out of the trees where the leaves were their protection.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 430320]), Text sample: Rynch went flat on the stream bank, made a worm's progress up the slope to crouch behind a bush and survey the land immediately ahead. There stood an off world spacer, fins down, nose skyward, and grouped not too far from its landing ramp, a collection of bubble tents.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89040]), Text sample: A fire burned in their midst and men were moving about it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 336960]), Text sample: Now that he was free from the wood and its watchers and had come so near to his goal, Rynch was curiously reluctant to do the sensible thing, to rise out of concealment and walk up to that fire, to claim rescue by his own kind.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 174480]), Text sample: The man he sought stood by the fire, shrugging his arms into a webbing harness which brought a box against his chest.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 85200]), Text sample: Having made that fast he picked up a needler by its sling.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 188880]), Text sample: By their gestures the others were arguing with him, but he shook his head, came on, to be a shadow stalking among other shadows.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 207360]), Text sample: One of the men trailed him, but as they reached a post planted a little beyond the bubble tents he stopped, allowed the explorer to advance alone into the dark.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45120]), Text sample: Rynch went to cover under a bush.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99840]), Text sample: Had they somehow learned of his own presence nearby, were they out to find him?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 25920]), Text sample: The watchers!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43440]), Text sample: Was the other out to spy on them?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35760]), Text sample: That idea made sense.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 254160]), Text sample: And in the meantime he would let the other past him, follow along behind until he was far enough from the camp so that his friends could not interfere-then, they would have a meeting!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58320]), Text sample: Rynch's fingers balled into fists.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 83280]), Text sample: That other would know, and would tell him the truth!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 141600]), Text sample: Alert as he was, he lost sight of the stranger who melted into the dusky cover of the shadows.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89760]), Text sample: The man from the spacer camp was using the stream as his road.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 186480]), Text sample: In spite of his caution Rynch was close to betrayal as he edged around a clump of vegetation growing half in, half out of the stream.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 101520]), Text sample: Only a timely rustle told him that the other had sat down on a drift log.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 21600]), Text sample: Waiting for him?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 97680]), Text sample: Rynch froze, so startled that he could not think clearly for a second.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 115200]), Text sample: Then he noted that the outline of the other's body was visible, growing brighter by the moment.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 134880]), Text sample: The dark shadow of an arm flapped, the radiance swirled, broke again into pinpoint sparks.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 154320]), Text sample: He pushed back into the bushes while the sparks still flitted, but they no longer gathered in strength enough to light his presence.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 149760]), Text sample: Now he could see they drifted about the vegetation, about the log where the man sat, about rocks and reeds.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 237839]), Text sample: He continued to keep them whirling by means of waving hand and arm, but there was enough light to show Rynch the fingers of his other hand, busy on the front panel of the box he wore.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 108719]), Text sample: That fingering stopped, then Rynch's head came up as he heard a very faint sound.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 70320]), Text sample: Not a beast's cry-or was it?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48960]), Text sample: Again those fingers moved on the panel.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58800]), Text sample: Was the other sending a message by that means?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 242401]), Text sample: Rynch watched him check the webbing, count the equipment at his belt, settle the needler in the crook of his arm. Then the stranger left the stream, headed towards the woods.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 110401]), Text sample: Rynch jumped to his feet, a cry of warning shaping, but not to be uttered.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32400]), Text sample: He padded after the other.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 124558]), Text sample: There was plenty of time to stop the man before he reached the danger which might lurk under the trees.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 132000]), Text sample: However the other was as wary of that dark as if he suspected what might lie in wait there.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 103440]), Text sample: Thankfully Rynch found his own lurking place from which he could keep the other in sight.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 124322]), Text sample: The light points gathered, hung in a small luminous cloud over the rocks.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 230159]), Text sample: But Rynch had prudently withdrawn under a bush, and the scent of its aromatic leaves must have discouraged the sparks, for no such crown came to his sentry post.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 134880]), Text sample: To open his eyes to this blue green pocket instead of to four dirty walls, was wrong.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 103440]), Text sample: Remembering, he started up and slunk down the slope, angry at his failure.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 257280]), Text sample: He found the other's track, not turning back as he had half feared, cleanly printed on level spots of wet earth-eastward now. What was the purpose of the other's expedition?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 257760]), Text sample: The man from the spacer had made no effort to conceal his trail, in fact it would almost seem that he had deliberately gone out of his way to leave boot prints on favorable stretches of ground.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 127200]), Text sample: Did he guess that Rynch lurked behind, was now leading him on for some purpose of his own?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67440]), Text sample: Or were those traces left to guide another party from the camp?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 77519]), Text sample: To advance openly up the stream bed was to invite discovery.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41040]), Text sample: Rynch surveyed the nearer bank.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 130081]), Text sample: Clumps of small trees and high growing bushes dotted that expanse, an ideal cover.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 122161]), Text sample: And the feline was attacking an enemy, enraged to the pitch of vocal frenzy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 93600]), Text sample: Rynch ran a zigzag course from one clump of bush to the next.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 176639]), Text sample: That sound of snarling, spitting hate ended in mid cry as Rynch crawled to the river bank.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 144961]), Text sample: The man from the spacer camp had been the focus of a three prong attack from a female and her cubs.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 185280]), Text sample: Three red bodies were flat and still on the gravel as the off worlder leaned back against a rock breathing heavily.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 237359]), Text sample: As Rynch sighted him, he stooped to recover the needler he had dropped, lurched away from the rock towards the water, and so blundered straight into another Jumalan trap.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 221519]), Text sample: His unsteady foot advancing for another step came down on a slippery surface, and he fell forward as his legs were engulfed in the trap burrow of a strong jaws.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 223202]), Text sample: The man eyed him steadily, and his expression did not alter even when Rynch swung the off world weapon to center its sights on the late owner.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 159120]), Text sample: "Suppose," Rynch's voice was rusty sounding in his own ears, "we talk now."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 25199]), Text sample: The man nodded.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37681]), Text sample: "As you wish, Brodie."

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 185520]), Text sample: "I know but of two that I can recommend from personal knowledge; but these two officers I can venture to pledge myself for."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 18480]), Text sample: "Any more?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147840]), Text sample: Edward went to Chaloner and Grenville, who were delighted with the intelligence which he brought them.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 97920]), Text sample: The next day they were at the prince's levee, and introduced by Edward.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 288720]), Text sample: But eventually Conde was beaten back by the superior force of Turenne; and, not receiving the assistance he expected from the Spaniards, he fell back to the frontiers of Champagne.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 281520]), Text sample: The Prince of Conde now had the command of the Spanish forces in the Netherlands; and Edward, with his friends, followed his fortunes, and gained his good will: they were rapidly promoted.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 288480]), Text sample: Turenne bore down Conde, who had gained every campaign; and the court of Spain, wearied with reverses, made overtures of peace, which was gladly accepted by the French.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 307440]), Text sample: Edward, who but rarely heard from Humphrey, was now anxious to quit the army and go to the king, who was in Spain; but to leave his colors, while things were adverse, was impossible.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 195360]), Text sample: After the peace and the pardon of Conde by the French king, the armies were disbanded, and the three adventurers were free.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20880]), Text sample: Do you recognize them?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 163441]), Text sample: "Yes," replied Grenville, "there can be no doubt of that; but will they, think you, recognize us?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 192479]), Text sample: "Is it possible," thought Edward, "that these can be the two girls in russet gowns, that I left at the cottage?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 28320]), Text sample: And yet it must be.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 114481]), Text sample: Well, Chaloner, to all appearance, your good aunts have done justice to their charge."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 36000]), Text sample: "Nature has done more, Edward.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 80400]), Text sample: As they passed, Edward caught the eye of Edith, and smiled.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 149520]), Text sample: "Alice, that's Edward!" said Edith, so loud, as to be heard by the king, and all near him.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 255359]), Text sample: We pass over the joy of this meeting after so many years' absence, and the pleasure which it gave to Edward to find his sisters grown such accomplished and elegant young women.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 224880]), Text sample: That his two friends, who were, as the reader will recollect, old acquaintances of Alice and Edith, were warmly received, we hardly need say.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 149520]), Text sample: "Now, Edward, who do you think was here to day-the reigning belle, and the toast of all the gentlemen?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 17281]), Text sample: "Indeed!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 143520]), Text sample: "No less than one with whom you were formerly well acquainted, Edward-Patience Heatherstone."

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 22800]), Text sample: "A few days back.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 108959]), Text sample: Humphrey has charge of it until it is ascertained to whom it is to belong."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 79440]), Text sample: "It belongs to mr Heatherstone, does it not?" replied Edward.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99121]), Text sample: "Yes, I did; but let us not talk about it any more, my dear Edith.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37202]), Text sample: "What is your perplexity?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 163680]), Text sample: "Well," replied Edward, "since it is to be so, let us sit down and talk over the matter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 378238]), Text sample: I acknowledge the kindness of mr Heatherstone, and feel that all he asserted to Humphrey is true: still I do not like that I should be indebted to him for a property which is mine, and that he has no right to give.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 129359]), Text sample: I acknowledge his generosity, but I do not acknowledge his right of possession.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 477360]), Text sample: Nay, much as I admire, and I may say, fond as I am (for time has not effaced the feeling) of his daughter, it still appears to me that, although not said, it is expected that she is to be included in the transfer; and I will accept no wife on such conditions."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 288000]), Text sample: "That is to say, because all you wish for, your property and a woman you love, are offered you in one lot, you will not accept them; they must be divided, and handed over to you in two!" said Alice, smiling.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 118800]), Text sample: "You mistake, dearest; I am not so foolish; but I have a certain pride, which you can not blame.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 152401]), Text sample: Accepting the property from mr Heatherstone is receiving a favor were it given as a marriage portion with his daughter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 28080]), Text sample: He can not refuse it."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74642]), Text sample: "Put not your trust in princes, brother," replied Alice.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 218160]), Text sample: Recollect also that mr Heatherstone, and his brother in law, Sir Ashley Cooper, have done the king much more service than you ever have or can do.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 173760]), Text sample: They have been most important agents in his restoration, and the king's obligations to them are much greater than they are to you.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 180481]), Text sample: At all events, Edward, recollect you do not know what are the intentions of mr Heatherstone; wait and see what he proffers first."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 93599]), Text sample: He is not going to surrender my property and make me a present of the house."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56640]), Text sample: "The reason for rebuilding the mansion was good.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 104640]), Text sample: You were at the wars; it was possible that you might, or might not return.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 124080]), Text sample: "Your advice is good, my dear Alice, and I will be guided by it," replied Edward.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 203760]), Text sample: That much of their property has been taken away and put into other hands, I know; and probably they expect it will be restored upon their application to the king.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 104642]), Text sample: Those who hold the property think so too, and so far it is fortunate.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 94080]), Text sample: Now is their time: even a few days' delay may make a difference.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 103440]), Text sample: "We must go now, and I will not fail to communicate it to them this very night."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 251041]), Text sample: We may as well here inform the reader that the advice was immediately acted upon, and that Chaloner and Grenville recovered all their estates at about five years' purchase.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49680]), Text sample: Edward remained at court several days.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 137759]), Text sample: He had written to Humphrey, and had dispatched a messenger with the letter; but the messenger had not yet returned.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 86401]), Text sample: The court was now one continual scene of fetes and gayety.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 116880]), Text sample: On the following day a drawing room was to be held, and Edward's sisters were to be presented.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 639841]), Text sample: Edward was standing, with many others of the suit, behind the chair of the king, amusing himself with the presentations as they took place, and waiting for the arrival of his sisters-Chaloner and Grenville were not with him, they had obtained leave to go into the country, for the object we have before referred to-when his eyes caught, advancing toward the king, mr Heatherstone, who led his daughter, Patience.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 422160]), Text sample: That they had not perceived him was evident; indeed her eyes were not raised once, from the natural timidity felt by a young woman in the presence of royalty. Edward half concealed himself behind one of his companions that he might gaze upon her without reserve.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 496802]), Text sample: There was the same pensive, sweet expression in her face, which had altered little; but the beautiful rounded arms, the symmetrical fall of the shoulders, and the proportion of the whole figure was a surprise to him; and Edward, in his own mind, agreed that she might well be the reigning toast of the day.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 106321]), Text sample: After he had saluted her, the king said, loud enough for Edward to hear,
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66718]), Text sample: I trust that the daughter will often grace our court."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 173760]), Text sample: Patience made no reply, but passed on; and, soon afterward, Edward lost sight of her in the crowd.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 117598]), Text sample: When he entered the room, he found himself in the arms of Humphrey, who had arrived with the messenger.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 55201]), Text sample: After the greetings were over, Edward said,
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 112559]), Text sample: "Alice and I have seen Patience, and I fear I must surrender at discretion.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 144000]), Text sample: mr Heatherstone may make his own terms; I must wave all pride rather than lose her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 207120]), Text sample: I thought that I had more control over myself; but I have seen her, and feel that my future happiness depends upon obtaining her as a wife.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 133439]), Text sample: Let her father but give me her, and Arnwood will be but a trifle in addition!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 156961]), Text sample: "With respect to the conditions upon which you are to possess Arnwood," said Humphrey, "I can inform you what they are.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 190802]), Text sample: They are wholly unshackled, further than that you are to repay by installments the money expended in the building of the house.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 273838]), Text sample: This I am empowered to state to you, and I think you will allow that mr Heatherstone has fully acted up to what he stated were his views when he first obtained a grant of the property."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48721]), Text sample: "He has, indeed," replied Edward.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 144718]), Text sample: "As for his daughter, Edward, you have yet to 'win her and wear her,' as the saying is.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 276481]), Text sample: Her father will resign the property to you as yours by right, but you have no property in his daughter, and I suspect that she will not be quite so easily handed over to you."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 50160]), Text sample: "But why should you say so, Humphrey?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53520]), Text sample: Have we not been attached from our youth?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 186721]), Text sample: "Yes, it was a youthful passion, I grant; but recollect nothing came of it, and years have passed away.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 212640]), Text sample: It is now seven years since you quitted the forest, and in your letters to mr Heatherstone you made no remark upon what had passed between you and Patience.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72721]), Text sample: "Well, my view is different," replied Edith.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 161282]), Text sample: "You know, Humphrey, how many offers Patience Heatherstone has had, and has every day, I may say.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 59760]), Text sample: "It may be so, Edith," replied Humphrey.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 61922]), Text sample: "Much you know about women," replied Edith.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 152159]), Text sample: "Very true, my dear sister; perhaps that is the reason that the New Forest has had such charms for me."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 119042]), Text sample: "After that speech, sir, the sooner you get back again the better!" retorted Edith.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74162]), Text sample: But Edward made a sign to Humphrey, and they beat a retreat.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42241]), Text sample: "Have you seen the intendant, Humphrey?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89279]), Text sample: "No; I was about to call upon him, but I wanted to see you first."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20402]), Text sample: "I will go with you.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72240]), Text sample: What must he think of my not having called upon him!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 14880]), Text sample: "Nothing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35042]), Text sample: You hold a place at court.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 127199]), Text sample: Tell him that I have just made known to you his noble and disinterested conduct."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34081]), Text sample: "You are right-I will.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 117361]), Text sample: I fear, however, Humphrey, that you are right and Edith wrong as regards his daughter."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68640]), Text sample: Edward was most kindly received by mr Heatherstone.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 225601]), Text sample: Edward, on mr Heatherstone repeating to him his intentions relative to Arnwood, expressed his sense of that gentleman's conduct, simply adding-
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 119520]), Text sample: "You may think me impetuous, sir, but I trust you will believe me grateful."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90000]), Text sample: Patience colored up and trembled when Edward first saw her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 126480]), Text sample: Edward did not refer to the past for some time after they had renewed their acquaintance.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 27838]), Text sample: Then all was explained.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 532081]), Text sample: About a year after the Restoration, there was a fete at Hampton Court, given in honor of three marriages taking place-Edward Beverley to Patience Heatherstone, Chaloner to Alice, and Grenville to Edith; and, as his majesty himself said, as he gave away the brides, "Could loyalty be better rewarded?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 209760]), Text sample: But our young readers will not be content if they do not hear some particulars about the other personages who have appeared in our little history.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43199]), Text sample: Humphrey must take the first place.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 38402]), Text sample: His love of farming continued.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 186238]), Text sample: Edward gave him a large farm, rent free; and in a few years Humphrey saved up sufficient to purchase a property for himself.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 438961]), Text sample: He then married Clara Ratcliffe, who has not appeared lately on the scene, owing to her having been, about two years before the Restoration, claimed by an elderly relation, who lived in the country, and whose infirm state of health did not permit him to quit the house.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99120]), Text sample: He left his property to Clara, about a year after her marriage to Humphrey.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 196321]), Text sample: This is all that we have been able to collect relative to the several parties; and so now we must say farewell.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99840]), Text sample: Fears in that direction have been uttered repeatedly, but from very different standpoints.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 332880]), Text sample: It is claimed that suggestive power, especially in the form of hypnotization, may be secretly misused to make anyone without his knowledge and against his will a passive instrument of the hypnotist's intent.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 73440]), Text sample: Often this is coupled with telepathic fancies.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 81120]), Text sample: All hypnotizing therefore ought to be interdicted by the state.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 222480]), Text sample: We know that hypnotism is not based on any special power of the hypnotizer; there is no magnetic fluid in the sense of the old mesmerism.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 423840]), Text sample: The imagination of the hypnotized person is the only hypnotizing agency. Thus no one can be hypnotized without his knowledge or against his will. The story of telepathic mysteries which is often brought before the public is probably always the outcome of a diseased brain.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 158400]), Text sample: But if we were to strike out all suggestive influences from social life, we should give up social life itself.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 264000]), Text sample: The good resolution and the bad one can be suggested, the good example and the bad can be effective; both encouragement of the noble and imitation of the evil may work with the same mental technique.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 270240]), Text sample: The easily suggestible person cannot be protected by any interdict; he may catch suggestions everywhere, any advertisement in the newspaper and any display in the shop window may overrun his own intentions.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67680]), Text sample: What he needs is training in firmness.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 190080]), Text sample: The application of reenforced suggestion or even of hypnotism in the doctor's office is even for him no possible source of danger.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 154320]), Text sample: On a higher level are objections which come from serious quarters and which are not without sympathy with true science.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 87600]), Text sample: In recent times this opposition has repeatedly found eloquent expression.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 277440]), Text sample: It is an objection from the standpoint of morality, belonging therefore entirely to the purposive view of the mind, but we have now reached a point where it is our duty to do justice to this purposive view too.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 193680]), Text sample: As long as we discussed the problem entirely from the standpoint of the physician, no other view of mental life except the causal one could be in question.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 128400]), Text sample: If there is moral criticism against suggestive therapy, it is the duty of the community to consider it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 207120]), Text sample: This opposition argues as follows: Hypnotic influence brings the patient under the will control of the hypnotizer and thus destroys his own freedom.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 318240]), Text sample: His achievement has therefore no moral value, and if he is really cured of his drunkenness or of his perverse habits, of his misuse of cocaine or of his criminal tendencies, he has lost the right to be counted a moral agent.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 153120]), Text sample: It would be better if there were more suffering in the world than that the existence of the moral will should be undermined.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49920]), Text sample: No one ought to take such arguments lightly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 216480]), Text sample: No one can insist too earnestly that life is worth living only if it serves moral duties and moral freedom and is not determined by pleasures and absence of pain only.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 154560]), Text sample: Those who set forth this argument are entirely willing to acknowledge the profound effect which suggestive therapeutics may create.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 443520]), Text sample: A forcible book of recent days calls the suggestive power of the psychotherapist "The Great Psychological Crime." It says to the hypnotist: "By your own testimony, you stand convicted of applying a process which deprives your subjects of the inalienable right and power of individual self control.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 203280]), Text sample: In proportion as you deprive him of the power of self control, you deprive him of that upon which his individual responsibility and moral status depend.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 209280]), Text sample: But this censure too is entirely mistaken, not because it urges the purposive views against the causal but because it is in error as to the facts.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 255840]), Text sample: Such critics are fully under the influence of the startling results which are reached; they do not take the trouble to examine the long and difficult way which has had to be traversed with patience and energy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 262800]), Text sample: It is quite true that if I hypnotize a man and suggest to him to take up after awaking the book which lies on my table, he follows my suggestion without conflict and in a certain sense without freedom.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 375120]), Text sample: He feels a simple impulse to go to the table and lift the book and, as no stronger natural desire and no moral objection stand in the way, he carries out that meaningless impulse and perhaps even invents a foolish motive to explain to himself why he wanted to look at that book.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 307200]), Text sample: But after a long experience, I have my doubts as to whether a man was ever cured in such a way by hypnotism of serious disturbances and of those anomalous actions which the critics want to see overcome by the patient's own moral efforts.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 238800]), Text sample: On the contrary, every suggestion has to rely on the efforts and struggles of the patient himself and all that the psychotherapists can give him is help in his own moral fight.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 256080]), Text sample: If again and again I hesitate to undertake new cases, it is just because I have to see during the treatment too much of this daily and hourly striving against overpowering impulses.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 250322]), Text sample: The joy of removing some obstacles from the way of the patients is too much overshadowed by the deep pity and sympathy with their suffering and craving during the whole period of successive treatments.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 214320]), Text sample: To make a man fight where despair is inevitable, and where the enemy is necessarily stronger than his own powers, can certainly not be the moral demand.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 159599]), Text sample: Morality postulates that everyone find conditions in which he can be victorious if he puts his strongest efforts to the task.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 215759]), Text sample: To make clear this purposive side of the case as against the causal one which alone interested the physician, I may add a few features to the short report as a typical example.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 149041]), Text sample: In truth it was the result of four months of the most noble and courageous suffering and struggling.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 59760]), Text sample: He had been for years a slave to his passion.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 250080]), Text sample: For the first few months, I found great relief after every injection of morphine, but soon I could not get the same easy feeling and could eat but very little and what sleep I got was in the daytime.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 194399]), Text sample: When I first went to see the professor in the Harvard Psychological Laboratory, I was using between thirty two and thirty eight grains of morphine daily.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 207839]), Text sample: He put me under his treatment october sixth and that day cut me down by hypnotic treatment to nine grains a day or three doses of three grains a day.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48000]), Text sample: The desire for the drug was something terrible.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 366961]), Text sample: But in about four days I got used to the loss of so much morphine and stayed on this amount for a week, seeing the professor every other day for hypnotic treatment and then returning to my room where I spent twenty two hours of the twenty four on the bed, but did not sleep more than two or three hours a day.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 134880]), Text sample: At the end of the week I was cut off by hypnotic suggestion half a grain and this put me to fighting the desire again.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 199680]), Text sample: The worst time of all was a cut from four injections of a fourth of a grain each to four of one eighth of a grain each, which was about january tenth.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 70322]), Text sample: At this time I had the worst two days of my life.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 142560]), Text sample: I tried whiskey, but it gave relief only for about half an hour and then the desire was worse than ever."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 397920]), Text sample: It was a moral victory when he finally reached the point at which he went for several weeks without any desire for morphine and finally presented the remaining tablets to a hospital. And yet there would not have been the least chance for his winning this ethical victory without the outer help of the hypnotist.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 118560]), Text sample: We do not eliminate the moral will but we remove some unfair obstacles from its path.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 164640]), Text sample: If that were immoral, we should have to make up our minds that all education and training were perverted with such immoral elements.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 266399]), Text sample: That is the glory of life that the suggestive power may belong to moral values instead of mere pleasures, but it is not the aim of life to remain untouched by suggestion.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 139680]), Text sample: Much more justified than such ethical objections are the fears which move entirely in the causal sphere.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 323279]), Text sample: It must be acknowledged that a method which has such powerful influence over the mind that it can secure ideas and emotions and impulses which the own will of the patient cannot produce, ought to be allowed only to those who are prepared for its skillful use.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 151919]), Text sample: To hypnotize or to perform any persistent psychotherapeutic treatment may thus be dangerous, if it is done by the unfit.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 348480]), Text sample: We have discussed before the injuries which might result from the administration of such powerful psychotherapeutic effects through the best meaning minister, but we can extend this fear to anyone who has not systematically studied medicine and to a certain degree normal and abnormal psychology.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 488880]), Text sample: The possibilities of overlooking symptoms which ought to suggest an entirely different treatment, or of adjusting the treatment badly to the special physical conditions, or of ignoring the desirable physical supplement by drugs, or of creating unintentionally by suggestion injurious effects, are always open when medical amateurs undertake such work.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 366480]), Text sample: All that involves the conviction that even the experimental psychologist as such is not prepared to enter into medical treatment; and a "Psychological Clinic," managed by a psychologist who is not a doctor of medicine, is certainly not better than a church clinic.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 149041]), Text sample: I cannot even acknowledge the right of psychologists to make hypnotic experiments merely for the psychological experiment's sake.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 196560]), Text sample: Nobody ought to be brought into a hypnotic or otherwise abnormal state of mind if it is not suggested by the interests of the subject himself.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 442560]), Text sample: Science has the right to make hypnotic experiments, or experiments with abnormal mental states, only under the one condition that a physician has hypnotized the subject in the interests of his health and that the patient has agreed beforehand to allow in the presence of witnesses certain psychological studies.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 222240]), Text sample: Needless to say that any hypnotization for mere amusement and as a parlor trick ought to be considered as criminal.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 222960]), Text sample: We spoke of the danger which the mental cures carry with them when they are based on any particular creed, and especially when they are tied up with a semi religious arbitrary metaphysics.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 277922]), Text sample: What is gained if some nervous disorders are helped by belief, if the belief itself devastates our intellectual culture and brings the masses down again to a view of the world which has all the earmarks of barbarism?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 323282]), Text sample: That is indeed one of the central dangers of all non medical suggestive cures, that while any belief may cure through the mere emotional power of the act of believing, the content of the belief gains an undeserved appearance of truth.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 165120]), Text sample: Any absurd superstition can become accredited because its curative value may be equal to a truly valuable suggestion.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 490321]), Text sample: The intellectual life of the community would have to suffer greatly if the way to be freed from bodily suffering had to be the belief in the metaphysical doctrines of mrs Eddy's "Science and Health." From a cultural viewpoint, too, suggestive therapeutics must stand the higher, the more sharply it is separated from special philosophical or religious doctrines.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 185039]), Text sample: No theory of the world and of God ought to gain authority over the mind from such an external motive as a belief in its curative effects.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 361919]), Text sample: Freest from such implications is certainly the hypnotic method of the physician who does not need the strong religious reenforcement of the suggestion because he reenforces instead the suggestibility of the patient by slight influences on his senses.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 324240]), Text sample: Even where sound religion without superstition and without pseudophilosophy stands behind the therapeutic work, the community will not give up the question whether the church does not necessarily neglect by it the interests which are superior.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 187441]), Text sample: The community becomes more and more strongly aware that too many factors of our modern society urge the church to undertake non religious work.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 149042]), Text sample: Social aid and charity work ought to be filled with religious spirit, but to perform it is not itself religion.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 304562]), Text sample: Still more that is true of the healing of the sick. Whether or not such expansion of church activity in different directions saps the vital strength of religion itself is indeed a problem for the whole community.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 522240]), Text sample: The fear suggests itself that the spiritual achievement may become hampered, that in the competition of the church with the other agencies of social life the particular church task may be pushed to the background, and that thus the church in imitating that which others can do just as well or better loses the power to do that which the church alone can do.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 305282]), Text sample: From whatever starting point we may come, we are led to the conviction that the physician alone is called to administer psychotherapeutic work, but that he needs a thorough psychological training besides his medical one.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 268321]), Text sample: Both educators and criminologists have indeed often raised such questions, and social reformers have not seldom seen there wide perspectives for social movements in future times.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 172562]), Text sample: When we spoke of the treatment of the sick, we had always to emphasize that the suggestion cures symptoms but not diseases.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 271201]), Text sample: Yes, the artificial reenforcement of such special features would deprive education of that which is the most essential, namely, the development of the power to overcome difficulties by own energy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 234961]), Text sample: Wherever a reasonable amount of own will force and attention can be expected to overcome the antagonistic influence, there artificial hypnotic influence ought to be avoided.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 205922]), Text sample: Everything ought to be left in that case to suggestions within normal limits, in the form of good example and persuasions, authority and discipline, love and sympathy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 169201]), Text sample: That holds true even for very slight abnormalities which seem still within the limits where the own energies can bring about the cure.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 269280]), Text sample: For instance, I have steadily refused requests of students and others to use hypnotism for the purpose of overcoming merely bad habits, such as the habit of biting the nails.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 288480]), Text sample: A child who finds some difficulty in sticking seriously to his tasks might learn now this and now that under the influence of hypnotic suggestions but he would remain entirely untrained for mastering the next lesson.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63838]), Text sample: Still more complex is the criminological problem.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 263039]), Text sample: And if the absurdity of such a proposal is recognized it seems to many justified to demand such an intrusion at least in the case of the born criminal, even if the occasional criminal cannot be reached.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 150481]), Text sample: The varieties which nature really produces are brains which are more liable than others to produce antisocial actions.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 193201]), Text sample: We recognized from the start that the abnormal mind never introduces any new elements but is characterized only by a change of proportions.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 235442]), Text sample: There is too much or too little of a certain mental process and just for that reason there must be a steady and continuous transition from the normal to the entirely abnormal.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 234478]), Text sample: Here again we have not a special class of brains which are criminal; but we have an endless variety of brains with a greater or smaller predisposition for antisocial outbreaks.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 121682]), Text sample: The variations which produce this criminal effect may lie in most different directions.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 222481]), Text sample: The fact that selfish and thus antisocial desires awake in the mind is not abnormal at all; only if they are not normally inhibited, the disturbance sets in.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 206640]), Text sample: Furthermore the associative apparatus of the brain may work especially slowly; it may thus bring it about that the counteracting ideas do not arise in time.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 152159]), Text sample: Or there may be negative suggestibility, by which a moral admonition stirs up a vivid idea of the opposite.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 267838]), Text sample: In short, there may be a large number of factors, sometimes even in combination, each one of which increases the chances that the individual may come in danger in the midst of developed society.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 40559]), Text sample: No character is perfect.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 330718]), Text sample: All that society can do is, therefore, not to remodel the manifoldness of brains, but to shape the conditions of life in such a way that the weak and unstable brains also have a greater chance to live their lives without conflicts with the community.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 185760]), Text sample: The situation is different as soon as the particular surroundings have brought it about that such a brain with reduced powers has entered a criminal career.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 103441]), Text sample: The thought of crime now becomes a sort of obsession or rather an autosuggestion.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 200159]), Text sample: If such cases should come early to suggestive treatment which really would close the channels of the antisocial autosuggestion, much harm might be averted.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 278642]), Text sample: Yet again the liability of the brain to become antisocial would not have been removed, and thus not much would be secured unless such a person after the treatment could be kept under favorable conditions.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 320880]), Text sample: With young boys who through unfortunate influence have caught a tendency, for instance, to steal, and where the fault does not yield to sympathetic reasoning and to punishment, an early hypnotic treatment might certainly be tried.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48720]), Text sample: I myself have seen promising results.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 298799]), Text sample: But if the impulse has irresistible character in such a way that the good will is powerless, we are again in the field of disease and the point of view of the physician has to be substituted for that of the criminologist.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 158880]), Text sample: Whether pedagogy and criminology are to make use of the services of psychotherapy is thus certainly an open question.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 187439]), Text sample: The artificial over suggestions which are needed to overcome the pathological disturbances of mental equilibrium may be left for the cases of illness.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 285120]), Text sample: To reduce these abnormalities means to secure a more stable equilibrium and thus to avoid social damages, and at the same time to prevent the growth of the abnormality to pathological dimensions.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 218400]), Text sample: To counteract these slighter variations, these abnormalities which have not yet reached the degree of disease, will demand the same principles of treatment, only in a weaker form.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 110880]), Text sample: It is in a way not psychical therapy but psychical hygiene.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 439679]), Text sample: And this is no longer confined to the physician but must be intrusted to all organs of the community. And here more than in the case of disease, the causal point of view of the physician ought to be brought into harmony with the purposive view of the social reformer, of the educator and of the moralist.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 172562]), Text sample: The ideal of such mental hygiene is the complete equilibrium of all mental energies together with their fullest possible development.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 351121]), Text sample: To work towards this end does not mean to aim towards the impossible and undesirable end of making all men alike, but to give to all, in spite of the differences which nature and society condition, the greatest possible inner completeness and outer usefulness.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 295442]), Text sample: The efforts in that direction have to begin with the earliest infancy and are at no age to be considered as finished; the whole school work and to a high degree the professional work has to be subordinated to such endeavor.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 401042]), Text sample: Society has further to take care that those spheres of life which stand less under systematic principles, such as the home life of the child and the social life of the man, his family life and his public life, are steadily under the pressure of influences which urge in the same direction.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 178801]), Text sample: Harmonious development without one sidedness, and yet with full justice to the individual talents and equipments, should be secured.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 152160]), Text sample: That means from the start an effort to secure balance between general education and particular development.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 184802]), Text sample: The latter has to strengthen those powers by which the boy or girl by special natural fitness promises to be especially efficient and happy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 253199]), Text sample: More important, it would leave undeveloped that power which the youth especially needs to acquire by serious education, the power to master what does not appeal to the personal likings and interests.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 225358]), Text sample: An equilibrium is secured only if at the same time full emphasis is given to the learning and training in all which is the common ground of our social existence.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 331201]), Text sample: From the multiplication table to the highest cultural studies in college, the youth is to be adjusted to the material of our civilization without any concession to the emasculating desire to adjust civilization simply to the particular youth.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 294000]), Text sample: He has to learn learning and not only to play with knowledge, he has to learn to force his attention in adjustment to those factors of civilization which are foreign to his personal tendencies and perhaps unsympathetic.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 166802]), Text sample: Free election of life's work and unyielding mental discipline in the service of the common demands should thus steadily cooeperate.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 160319]), Text sample: The one without the other creates a lack of mental balance which is the most favorable condition for a pathological disturbance.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 128639]), Text sample: The mere learning is of course on both sides only a fraction of what the community has to develop in the youth.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 225361]), Text sample: The nourishment of the child, the care for the child's sense organs, the recesses and the rest from fatigue, and especially the undisturbed sleep are essential conditions.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 202081]), Text sample: It must not be forgotten that the decomposition of the brain molecules can never be restituted by anything but rest, and ultimately by sleep.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65279]), Text sample: Physical exercise is certainly not such restitution.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 116159]), Text sample: In the best case it brings a certain rest to some brain centers by engaging other brain parts.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 135838]), Text sample: The child needs sleep and fresh air and healthful food more than anything else, if his mind is active.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 203760]), Text sample: More important than mere physical hygiene is the demand that a sound character and a sound temperament are also to be built up, at the side of a sound interest.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 159841]), Text sample: The emotional stability and emotional enlargement of the mind is perhaps most neglected in our educational schemes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 165120]), Text sample: On the one side it demands a systematic discipline of the emotions, on the other a healthy stimulation of emotions.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 175198]), Text sample: Destructive emotions like terror ought to be kept away and not needlessly brought near by uncanny stories and mystic superstitions.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 443279]), Text sample: Again in the field of will, we want the strong, spontaneous, independent will which is not frightened by discomfort and not discouraged by obstacles, and yet we want the will which is not stubborn and selfish but which subordinates itself to the larger will of the social group and to the eternal will of the norm.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 168000]), Text sample: The whole social life must shape itself in such a way that everyone finds the best possible chances to perfect this harmonious growth.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 257520]), Text sample: In the field of the intellect, the community must take care that thoroughness of training and accuracy of information is rigidly demanded and not thrust out by an easy going superficiality.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 281760]), Text sample: Yet while thoroughness demands concentration in one direction, society must with the same earnestness insist on well rounded general education and continuity of general interests through life.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 267598]), Text sample: Literature and the libraries, the newspapers and the magazines play there a foremost role, and again the mental health of the community has to pay the penalty if its newspapers work against general culture.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 371039]), Text sample: But with this enrichment of feelings the disciplinary influence too has to go through the whole social life. Where art is sensational and the church hysterical,--in short, where the community stirs up overstrong feelings,--the wholesome balance is lost again.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 106559]), Text sample: Few factors are more influential in all these directions than the administration of law.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 203039]), Text sample: Sound sober lawmaking and fair judgment in court secure to the community a feeling of safety which gives stability to emotions and feelings.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 125039]), Text sample: A similar unbalancing influence emanates from overstrong contrasts of poverty and comfort.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 226558]), Text sample: There is no doubt the arbitrary suppression of the sexual instinct must be acknowledged as the source of nervous injury while indulgence may lead to disease and misery.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 117838]), Text sample: Not less difficult and not less connected with the mental hygiene is the alcohol problem.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 606955]), Text sample: Its intemperate use or its use by young people and by pathological persons is one of the gravest dangers. Whether intemperance ought to be fought by prohibition or rather by an education to temperance is a difficult question in which the enthusiastic women and ministers, backed by the well justified fears of psychiatrists, will hardly be on the same side as the sober judgment of scientists, unprejudiced physicians, and historians.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 188877]), Text sample: In any case the saloon and its humiliating indecency must disappear and every temptation to intemperance should be removed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 318961]), Text sample: Above all, from early childhood the self control has to be strengthened, the child has to learn from the beginning to know the limits to the gratification of his desires and to abstain from reckless over indulgence.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 129598]), Text sample: With such a training later on even the temptations of alcoholic beverages would lose their danger.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89280]), Text sample: Not less injurious than the strong drinks are the cards.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 160799]), Text sample: All gambling from the child's play to the stock exchange is ruinous for the psychophysical equilibrium.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 240721]), Text sample: The same is true of any overuse of coffee and tea and tobacco, and as a matter of course still more the habitual use of the drugs like the popular headache powders and sleeping medicines.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 162955]), Text sample: The life at home and in public ought to be manifold and expansive but ought to avoid over excitement and over anxiety.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 325201]), Text sample: A good conscience, a congenial home, and a serious purpose are after all the safest conditions for a healthy mind, and the community works in preventive psychotherapy wherever it facilitates the securing of these three factors.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 161039]), Text sample: For that end society may take over directly from the workshop of the psychotherapist quite a number of almost technical methods.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 503279]), Text sample: No one can measure the injury done to the psychophysical balance of the weaker brains, for instance, by the sensational court gossip and reports of murder trials in the newspapers for the masses. But while the influence of suggestion is on the whole familiar to public opinion, the community is much less aware of another factor which we found important in the hands of the psychotherapist.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 143760]), Text sample: We recognized that mental disturbances were often the result of suppressed emotion and repressed wishes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 103675]), Text sample: For the cure the psychotherapist has to aim toward the cathartic result.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 375597]), Text sample: The suppressed ideas had to be brought to consciousness again and then to be discharged through vivid expression. Society ought to learn from it that few factors are more disturbing for the mental balance than feelings and emotions which do not come to a normal expression.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 298318]), Text sample: It is no chance that in countries of mixed Protestant and Catholic civilization, the number of suicides is larger in Protestant regions than in the Catholic ones where the confessional relieves the suppressed emotions of the masses.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 191279]), Text sample: This is also the most destructive effect of social and legal injustice; emotions are strangulated and then begin to work mischief.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 219358]), Text sample: The community should take care early that secret feelings are avoided, that the child is cured from all sullenness which stores up the emotion instead of discharging it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 196799]), Text sample: All life becomes a psychophysical mechanism and from that point of view man's thinking and acting become the necessary outcome of the foregoing conditions.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 101279]), Text sample: Nothing seems more unfit to give a deeper meaning to life and a higher value.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 395279]), Text sample: And yet if there was one thought which controlled our discussion from the beginning, it was certainly the conviction that this causal view itself is only an instrument in the service of idealistic endeavors; the reality of man's life is the reality of will and freedom directed towards ideals.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 202798]), Text sample: In the service of our ideals we may thus transform the world into a mechanism: out of our freedom we desire to conceive ourselves as necessary products.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 560877]), Text sample: Whenever we aim to produce changes in the world, we must calculate the effects through the means of this causal construction, but we never have a right to forget that this calculation itself is therefore only a tool and that our reality, in which our duties and our real aims lie, is itself outside of this construction. The psychotherapist wants to produce effects inasmuch as he wants to cure disease.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23520]), Text sample: THE AWAKENING
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33600]), Text sample: An awakening came.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56160]), Text sample: What a wonderfully complex thing!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 689520]), Text sample: this simple seeming unity-the self! Who can trace its reintegration as morning after morning we awaken, the flux and confluence of its countless factors interweaving, rebuilding, the dim first stirrings of the soul, the growth and synthesis of the unconscious to the subconscious, the subconscious to dawning consciousness, until at last we recognise ourselves again.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 172560]), Text sample: And as it happens to most of us after the night's sleep, so it was with Graham at the end of his vast slumber.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 265920]), Text sample: A dim cloud of sensation taking shape, a cloudy dreariness, and he found himself vaguely somewhere, recumbent, faint, but alive.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 179760]), Text sample: The pilgrimage towards a personal being seemed to traverse vast gulfs, to occupy epochs.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 289200]), Text sample: Gigantic dreams that were terrible realities at the time, left vague perplexing memories, strange creatures, strange scenery, as if from another planet.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 553200]), Text sample: There was a distinct impression, too, of a momentous conversation, of a name-he could not tell what name-that was subsequently to recur, of some queer long forgotten sensation of vein and muscle, of a feeling of vast hopeless effort, the effort of a man near drowning in darkness.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 128880]), Text sample: Then came a panorama of dazzling unstable confluent scenes....
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 142080]), Text sample: Graham became aware that his eyes were open and regarding some unfamiliar thing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 113760]), Text sample: It was something white, the edge of something, a frame of wood.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 105600]), Text sample: He moved his head slightly, following the contour of this shape.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63120]), Text sample: It went up beyond the top of his eyes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53040]), Text sample: He tried to think where he might be.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64800]), Text sample: Did it matter, seeing he was so wretched?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 76320]), Text sample: The colour of his thoughts was a dark depression.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 120720]), Text sample: He felt the featureless misery of one who wakes towards the hour of dawn.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 122640]), Text sample: He had an uncertain sense of whispers and footsteps hastily receding.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 123600]), Text sample: The movement of his head involved a perception of extreme physical weakness.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 165840]), Text sample: He supposed he was in bed in the hotel at the place in the valley-but he could not recall that white edge.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32880]), Text sample: He must have slept.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 69360]), Text sample: He remembered now that he had wanted to sleep.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 185040]), Text sample: He recalled the cliff and Waterfall again, and then recollected something about talking to a passer by....
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41520]), Text sample: How long had he slept?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56880]), Text sample: What was that sound of pattering feet?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 103680]), Text sample: And that rise and fall, like the murmur of breakers on pebbles?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 238320]), Text sample: He put out a languid hand to reach his watch from the chair whereon it was his habit to place it, and touched some smooth hard surface like glass.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99120]), Text sample: This was so unexpected that it startled him extremely.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 143760]), Text sample: Quite suddenly he rolled over, stared for a moment, and struggled into a sitting position.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 160080]), Text sample: The effort was unexpectedly difficult, and it left him giddy and weak-and amazed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34800]), Text sample: He rubbed his eyes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 201120]), Text sample: The riddle of his surroundings was confusing but his mind was quite clear-evidently his sleep had benefited him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 235200]), Text sample: He was not in a bed at all as he understood the word, but lying naked on a very soft and yielding mattress, in a trough of dark glass.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 236880]), Text sample: The mattress was partly transparent, a fact he observed with a sense of insecurity, and below it was a mirror reflecting him greyly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 361680]), Text sample: About his arm-and he saw with a shock that his skin was strangely dry and yellow-was bound a curious apparatus of rubber, bound so cunningly that it seemed to pass into his skin above and below.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 235920]), Text sample: And this bed was placed in a case of greenish coloured glass (as it seemed to him), a bar in the white framework of which had first arrested his attention.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 298080]), Text sample: In the corner of the case was a stand of glittering and delicately made apparatus, for the most part quite strange appliances, though a maximum and minimum thermometer was recognisable.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 419040]), Text sample: The slightly greenish tint of the glass like substance which surrounded him on every hand obscured what lay behind, but he perceived it was a vast apartment of splendid appearance, and with a very large and simple white archway facing him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 430560]), Text sample: Close to the walls of the cage were articles of furniture, a table covered with a silvery cloth, silvery like the side of a fish, a couple of graceful chairs, and on the table a number of dishes with substances piled on them, a bottle and two glasses.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 76800]), Text sample: He realised that he was intensely hungry.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 251040]), Text sample: He could see no one, and after a period of hesitation scrambled off the translucent mattress and tried to stand on the clean white floor of his little apartment.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 202800]), Text sample: He had miscalculated his strength, however, and staggered and put his hand against the glass like pane before him to steady himself.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 267600]), Text sample: For a moment it resisted his hand, bending outward like a distended bladder, then it broke with a slight report and vanished-a pricked bubble.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 117360]), Text sample: He reeled out into the general space of the hall, greatly astonished.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 252720]), Text sample: He caught at the table to save himself, knocking one of the glasses to the floor-it rang but did not break-and sat down in one of the armchairs.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 367440]), Text sample: When he had a little recovered he filled the remaining glass from the bottle and drank-a colourless liquid it was, but not water, with a pleasing faint aroma and taste and a quality of immediate support and stimulus.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 62640]), Text sample: He put down the vessel and looked about him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 174000]), Text sample: The apartment lost none of its size and magnificence now that the greenish transparency that had intervened was removed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 254640]), Text sample: The archway he saw led to a flight of steps, going downward without the intermediation of a door, to a spacious transverse passage.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 371520]), Text sample: This passage ran between polished pillars of some white veined substance of deep ultramarine, and along it came the sound of human movements, and voices and a deep undeviating droning note.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 152640]), Text sample: He sat, now fully awake, listening alertly, forgetting the viands in his attention.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 229680]), Text sample: Then with a shock he remembered that he was naked, and casting about him for covering, saw a long black robe thrown on one of the chairs beside him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89280]), Text sample: This he wrapped about him and sat down again, trembling.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72720]), Text sample: His mind was still a surging perplexity.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90240]), Text sample: Clearly he had slept, and had been removed in his sleep.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 19200]), Text sample: But where?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 122880]), Text sample: And who were those people, the distant crowd beyond the deep blue pillars?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 25920]), Text sample: Boscastle?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 110161]), Text sample: He poured out and partially drank another glass of the colourless fluid.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 164401]), Text sample: What was this place?--this place that to his senses seemed subtly quivering like a thing alive?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 483599]), Text sample: He looked about him at the clean and beautiful form of the apartment, unstained by ornament, and saw that the roof was broken in one place by a circular shaft full of light, and, as he looked, a steady, sweeping shadow blotted it out and passed, and came again and passed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 173040]), Text sample: "Beat, beat," that sweeping shadow had a note of its own in the subdued tumult that filled the air.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 283440]), Text sample: He would have called out, but only a little sound came into his throat. Then he stood up, and, with the uncertain steps of a drunkard, made his way towards the archway.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 229920]), Text sample: He staggered down the steps, tripped on the corner of the black cloak he had wrapped about himself, and saved himself by catching at one of the blue pillars.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 381599]), Text sample: The passage ran down a cool vista of blue and purple and ended remotely in a railed space like a balcony brightly lit and projecting into a space of haze, a space like the interior of some gigantic building.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 113039]), Text sample: Beyond and remote were vast and vague architectural forms.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 426240]), Text sample: The tumult of voices rose now loud and clear, and on the balcony and with their backs to him, gesticulating and apparently in animated conversation, were three figures, richly dressed in loose and easy garments of bright soft colourings.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 426000]), Text sample: The noise of a great multitude of people poured up over the balcony, and once it seemed the top of a banner passed, and once some brightly coloured object, a pale blue cap or garment thrown up into the air perhaps, flashed athwart the space and fell.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 124800]), Text sample: The shouts sounded like English, there was a reiteration of "Wake!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 160800]), Text sample: He heard some indistinct shrill cry, and abruptly these three men began laughing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 87601]), Text sample: He turned his eyes full of merriment along the passage.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 113039]), Text sample: The other two turned swiftly at his exclamation and stood motionless.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 163440]), Text sample: Their faces assumed an expression of consternation, an expression that deepened into awe.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 243599]), Text sample: Suddenly Graham's knees bent beneath him, his arm against the pillar collapsed limply, he staggered forward and fell upon his face.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 59760]), Text sample: Fastidious correctness of form
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67920]), Text sample: Full of ardent affection and gratitude
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 71280]), Text sample: Guilty and baffled antagonists
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147840]), Text sample: He poured bitter and biting ridicule on his discomfited opponents
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68880]), Text sample: High and undiscouraged hope
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 94560]), Text sample: His mood was one of pure exaltation
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24960]), Text sample: CHAPTER nine
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 349440]), Text sample: At dinner it was announced that the famous Tarantella would be danced in the lower hall of the hotel at nine o'clock, and the girls told Uncle john that they must not miss this famous sight, which is one of the most unique in Sorrento, or indeed in all Italy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 136560]), Text sample: As they entered the pretty, circular hall devoted to the dance Louise gave a start of surprise.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 362400]), Text sample: A goodly audience had already assembled in the room, and among them the girl seemed to recognize an acquaintance, for after a brief hesitation she advanced and placed her hand in that of a gentleman who had risen on her entrance and hastened toward her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 138000]), Text sample: He was a nice looking young fellow, Beth thought, and had a foreign and quite distinguished air.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 350160]), Text sample: Presently Louise turned with cheeks somewhat flushed and brought the gentleman to her party, introducing him to Uncle john and her cousins as Count Ferralti, whom she had once met in New York while he was on a visit to America.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 183840]), Text sample: The Count twirled his small and slender moustaches in a way that Patsy thought affected, and said in excellent English:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 81360]), Text sample: "It delights me to meet mr Merrick and the young ladies.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 105120]), Text sample: May I express a hope that you are pleased with my beautiful country?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 101040]), Text sample: "Are you Italian?" asked Uncle john, regarding the young man critically.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 31200]), Text sample: "Surely, mr Merrick.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 158160]), Text sample: But I have resided much in New York, and may well claim to be an adopted son of your great city."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78960]), Text sample: "New York adopts a good many," said Uncle john, drily.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 73200]), Text sample: "It has even been thoughtless enough to adopt me."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 186240]), Text sample: The dancers entered at that moment and the Americans were forced to seat themselves hastily so as not to obstruct the view of others.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 307920]), Text sample: The dances were unique and graceful, being executed by a troup of laughing peasants dressed in native costume, who seemed very proud of their accomplishment and anxious to please the throng of tourists present.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 168240]), Text sample: The Tarantella originated in Ischia, but Sorrento and Capri have the best dancers.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 273600]), Text sample: Afterward Uncle john and his nieces stood upon the terrace and watched the volcano rolling its dense clouds, mingled with sparks of red hot scoria, toward the sky.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 135120]), Text sample: The Count clung to Louise's side, but also tried to make himself agreeable to her cousins.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 342480]), Text sample: In their rooms that night Patsy told Beth that the young foreigner was "too highfalutin' to suit her," and Beth replied that his manners were so like those of their Cousin Louise that the two ought to get along nicely together.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 333360]), Text sample: Uncle john liked his nieces to make friends, and encouraged young men generally to meet them; but there was something in the appearance of this callow Italian nobleman that stamped his character as artificial and insincere.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 201360]), Text sample: He resolved to find out something about his antecedents before he permitted the young fellow to establish friendly relations with his girls.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 222480]), Text sample: That gave him an excuse to talk with the man, who spoke very good English and was exceedingly courteous to his guests-especially when they were American.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24720]), Text sample: "Whom, sir?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 62640]), Text sample: "Ferralti-Count Ferralti.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 96720]), Text sample: "I-I did not know," he said, hesitatingly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 95280]), Text sample: "The gentleman arrived last evening, and I had not yet learned his name.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 292080]), Text sample: Let me see," he turned to his list of guests, who register by card and not in a book, and continued: "Ah, yes; he has given his name as Ferralti, but added no title.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39360]), Text sample: A count, did you say?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42480]), Text sample: "Yes," replied Uncle john.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 158880]), Text sample: Then he remarked that the eruption of Vesuvius was waning and the trouble nearly over for this time.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 61200]), Text sample: "That I cannot tell you, Signor Merrick."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 94080]), Text sample: "Oh. Perhaps you know little about the nobility of your country."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 15120]), Text sample: "I!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99120]), Text sample: I know little of the nobility!" answered Floriano, indignantly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 69840]), Text sample: "Yet you say you don't know the Ferralti family."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 80400]), Text sample: The proprietor reached for a book that lay above his desk.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 61200]), Text sample: Here is our record of nobility.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 97440]), Text sample: It is the same as the 'Blue Book' or the 'Peerage' of England.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 163440]), Text sample: Either fortunately or unfortunately-I cannot say-you have no need of such a book in America."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 85680]), Text sample: He turned the pages and ran his finger down the line of "f's."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 96720]), Text sample: "Find me, if you can, a Count Ferralti in the list."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51360]), Text sample: He put on his glasses and looked again.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 77280]), Text sample: The name of Ferralti was no place in the record.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 84000]), Text sample: Uncle john whistled softly and walked away to the window.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64800]), Text sample: The young man greeted him with a smile and a bow.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67200]), Text sample: "I misunderstood your name last evening," he said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 50160]), Text sample: "I thought you were Count Ferralti."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68640]), Text sample: "And that is right, sir," was the prompt reply.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51120]), Text sample: "Allow me to offer you my card."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 50880]), Text sample: Uncle john took the card and read:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64080]), Text sample: He carefully placed the card in his pocket book.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39360]), Text sample: Uncle john walked away.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 83280]), Text sample: He was glad that he had not suspected the young man unjustly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 94320]), Text sample: When an imposture is unmasked it is no longer dangerous.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 138720]), Text sample: He joined his nieces, who were all busily engaged in writing letters home, and remarked, casually:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 75360]), Text sample: "You've been deceived in your Italian friend, Louise.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 238320]), Text sample: He is neither a count nor of noble family, although I suppose when you met him in New York he had an object in posing as a titled aristocrat."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89280]), Text sample: The girl paused, examining the point of her pen thoughtfully.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49920]), Text sample: "Are you sure, Uncle john?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 36960]), Text sample: "Quite sure, my dear.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 111120]), Text sample: I've just been through the list of Italian counts, and his name is not there.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 151200]), Text sample: Floriano, the proprietor, who knows every aristocrat in Italy, has never before heard of him."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68880]), Text sample: "I wonder why he has tried to deceive us."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 154080]), Text sample: "Oh, the world is full of impostors; but when you are on to their game they are quite harmless.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 77040]), Text sample: Of course we won't encourage this young man in any way.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42960]), Text sample: It will be better to avoid him."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 122160]), Text sample: "He-he seems very nice and gentlemanly," said Louise with hesitation.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82800]), Text sample: The other girls exchanged glances, but made no remark.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66000]), Text sample: Uncle john hardly knew what to say further.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 360000]), Text sample: He felt he was in an awkward position, for Louise was the most experienced in worldly ways of his three nieces and he had no desire to pose as a stern guardian or to deprive his girls of any passing pleasure they might enjoy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 375840]), Text sample: Moreover, Louise being in love with that young Weldon her mother so strongly objected to, she would not be likely to care much for this Italian fellow, and mrs Merrick had enjoined him to keep her daughter's mind from dwelling on her "entanglement."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 100080]), Text sample: "Oh, well, my dear," he said to her, "you must act as you see fit.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 336480]), Text sample: I do not imagine we shall see much of this young man, in any event, and now that you are well aware of the fact that he is sailing under false colors, you will know how to handle him better than I can advise you."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 126241]), Text sample: "Well then, girls, what do you say to a stroll around the village?" asked their uncle.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 120960]), Text sample: "I'm told it's a proper place to buy silk stockings and inlaid wood work.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51839]), Text sample: They come assorted, I suppose."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 486240]), Text sample: Beth and Patsy jumped up with alacrity, but Louise pleaded that she had several more letters to write; so the others left her and passed the rest of the forenoon in rummaging among the quaint shops of Sorrento, staring at the statue of Tasso, and enjoying the street scenes so vividly opposed to those of America.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 101281]), Text sample: It was almost their first glimpse of foreign manners and customs.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64800]), Text sample: They both expected her to make trouble but were mistaken.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49199]), Text sample: First there was the old thing in him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48240]), Text sample: Instead he prayed for it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51599]), Text sample: As he talked his left eyelid twitched.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 94560]), Text sample: When he awoke at dawn the barnyard back of the house also awoke.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42000]), Text sample: In the house people stirred about.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 236400]), Text sample: "Four, five, six, seven," he said slowly, wetting his finger and making straight up and down marks on the window ledge.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 167522]), Text sample: "See, come here and look," cried the old man. "Grandfather Jesse's white mare has torn the black stocking she wears on her foot."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 25922]), Text sample: "Wake up, little animal.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 76081]), Text sample: "Make a sign to me, God," he cried.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 22799]), Text sample: "Take me away.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 230400]), Text sample: "The hand is not necessary," answered Nicholl, not at all confounded; "and as to the stone, let us suppose it to be a comet."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 212160]), Text sample: "I think that we can answer," said Barbicane; "but according to my idea the question ought not to be put in that form.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35520]), Text sample: I ask it to be put differently."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53520]), Text sample: "Here it is," continued Barbicane.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 91680]), Text sample: "And I answer in the negative," continued Barbicane.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46080]), Text sample: "Without a doubt!" answered Nicholl.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 174960]), Text sample: There remains but one hypothesis, that of a living race to which motion, which is life, is foreign."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 123600]), Text sample: "Just so," said Barbicane, "which for us has no meaning."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 140400]), Text sample: "Now," said Nicholl, "let us attack the second question, an indispensable complement of the first.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 205920]), Text sample: I ask the honorable commission, if the moon is not habitable, has she ever been inhabited, Citizen Barbicane?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 123118]), Text sample: The actual state of this cracked, twisted, and burst disc abundantly proves this.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43681]), Text sample: "I believe it," said Nicholl.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 88801]), Text sample: "At the terrestrial poles they last six months," said Michel.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60720]), Text sample: "And why?" asked Nicholl quickly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57118]), Text sample: Barbicane sought to restrain them.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24961]), Text sample: "By cooling?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 30479]), Text sample: "Most probably."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 18720]), Text sample: "But when?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 16800]), Text sample: "Certainly."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 13680]), Text sample: nine.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65520]), Text sample: It was, in fact, the princess laughing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 103200]), Text sample: "You naughty, naughty, NAUGHTY, NAUGHTY man!" she cried.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 31680]), Text sample: "I'll tell papa."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 31440]), Text sample: I pity you."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37920]), Text sample: "Put me up directly."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 40800]), Text sample: "Come, then," said the prince.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 144720]), Text sample: "How am I to put you in?" "That is your business," she answered, quite snappishly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48960]), Text sample: "You took me out-put me in again."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 141120]), Text sample: "Very well," said the prince; and, catching her up in his arms, he sprang with her from the rock.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64080]), Text sample: "Is that what you call FALLING IN?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 114720]), Text sample: The princess did not appear to understand him, for she retorted his question:--
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 17521]), Text sample: "Thank you.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 22560]), Text sample: But I don't care.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 224159]), Text sample: "I wish I hadn't one either," rejoined the princess; "it is so stupid! I have a great mind," she continued, "to play them all a trick.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 92640]), Text sample: She did not care who the man was; that was nothing to her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 91200]), Text sample: When she saw it she shrieked, and covered her face with her hands.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 114240]), Text sample: They bore her across to the stone where they had already placed a little boat for her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52080]), Text sample: In a few minutes the prince appeared.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42720]), Text sample: "Here I am," said the prince.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20640]), Text sample: "Put me in."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20160]), Text sample: Put me in."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24480]), Text sample: "Now you can go."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 40080]), Text sample: "Princess!" said he.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23520]), Text sample: I'm afloat!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54480]), Text sample: And the little boat bumped against the stone.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 70800]), Text sample: "Well?" said she, without looking round.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 77040]), Text sample: "There, then," said she, holding out the wine to him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34080]), Text sample: But the prince felt better.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90240]), Text sample: You must sit and look at me, else I shall not be able to keep up."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 69361]), Text sample: The princess gave a shriek, and sprang into the lake.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23040]), Text sample: THE CONCLUSION.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52800]), Text sample: "Hold your tongue," answered the Dervish.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23040]), Text sample: You know----"

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20640]), Text sample: It is enough."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 169920]), Text sample: Slowly and reluctantly yielding to the necessity, he quitted the place, and mingled with the throng that hovered nigh.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 183120]), Text sample: A knot of warriors soon entered the place again, and reissuing, they bore the senseless remains into the adjacent woods.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 215280]), Text sample: Though the return of Duncan was likely to remind them of his character, and the suspicious circumstances of his visit, it produced no visible sensation.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 430560]), Text sample: Without seeming to hesitate, he walked into the lodge, and took his seat with a gravity that accorded admirably with the deportment of his hosts. A hasty but searching glance sufficed to tell him that, though Uncas still remained where he had left him, David had not reappeared.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 302160]), Text sample: No other restraint was imposed on the former than the watchful looks of a young Huron, who had placed himself at hand; though an armed warrior leaned against the post that formed one side of the narrow doorway.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 193200]), Text sample: He would greatly have preferred silence and meditation to speech, when a discovery of his real condition might prove so instantly fatal.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 132480]), Text sample: Unfortunately for this prudent resolution, his entertainers appeared otherwise disposed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 217440]), Text sample: He had not long occupied the seat wisely taken a little in the shade, when another of the elder warriors, who spoke the French language, addressed him:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 117600]), Text sample: "My Canada father does not forget his children," said the chief; "I thank him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56400]), Text sample: Can the cunning stranger frighten him away?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 137040]), Text sample: "Spirits differ; some yield to the power of wisdom, while others are too strong."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 113760]), Text sample: "My brother is a great medicine," said the cunning savage; "he will try?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49680]), Text sample: A gesture of assent was the answer.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 165600]), Text sample: The Huron was content with the assurance, and, resuming his pipe, he awaited the proper moment to move.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 209040]), Text sample: The latter cast an impatient look at his neighbor, and felt his flesh creep with uncontrollable horror when he found himself in actual contact with Magua.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 121680]), Text sample: The sudden return of this artful and dreaded chief caused a delay in the departure of the Huron.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 84720]), Text sample: "Let 'Reed that bends' go on the hunting path; he will meet them."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 221762]), Text sample: The former was rather depressed, than remarkable for the bearing of the natives; and the latter was such as was commonly worn by the ordinary men of the nation.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 109920]), Text sample: "The Delawares have been like bears after the honey pots, prowling around my village.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48719]), Text sample: But who has ever found a Huron asleep?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 192961]), Text sample: The darkness of the impending cloud which precedes a burst of thunder was not blacker than the brow of Magua as he exclaimed:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 36959]), Text sample: "The Delawares of the Lakes!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43680]), Text sample: "Did my young men take his scalp?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 187199]), Text sample: "His legs were good, though his arm is better for the hoe than the tomahawk," returned the other, pointing to the immovable form of Uncas.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 458639]), Text sample: Instead of manifesting any womanish curiosity to feast his eyes with the sight of a captive from a people he was known to have so much reason to hate, Magua continued to smoke, with the meditative air that he usually maintained, when there was no immediate call on his cunning or his eloquence.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 253920]), Text sample: Near a minute these two bold and untamed spirits stood regarding one another steadily in the eye, neither quailing in the least before the fierce gaze he encountered.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 192720]), Text sample: The hated and yet respected name was repeated as by one voice, carrying the sound even beyond the limits of the lodge.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 215041]), Text sample: The women and children, who lingered around the entrance, took up the words in an echo, which was succeeded by another shrill and plaintive howl.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 377762]), Text sample: Magua caught the expression, and raising his arm, he shook it at the captive, the light silver ornaments attached to his bracelet rattling with the trembling agitation of the limb, as, in a tone of vengeance, he exclaimed, in English:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 155759]), Text sample: Many of the Hurons understood the strange tongue in which the captive spoke, among which number was Magua.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 112560]), Text sample: This cunning savage beheld, and instantly profited by his advantage.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 305520]), Text sample: However much his influence among his people had been impaired by his occasional and besetting weakness, as well as by his desertion of the tribe, his courage and his fame as an orator were undeniable.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 211200]), Text sample: He again recounted the events of the attack on the island at Glenn's, the death of his associates and the escape of their most formidable enemies.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 192480]), Text sample: Each dusky figure seemed a breathing statue, so motionless was the posture, so intense the attention of the individual.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147120]), Text sample: One had never been known to follow the chase in vain; another had been indefatigable on the trail of their enemies.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 61922]), Text sample: This was brave, that generous.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 27120]), Text sample: You know they are not.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 165361]), Text sample: Their spirits are gone toward the setting sun, and are already crossing the great waters, to the happy hunting grounds.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 175922]), Text sample: But they departed without food, without guns or knives, without moccasins, naked and poor as they were born.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 280799]), Text sample: Shall this be? Are their souls to enter the land of the just like hungry Iroquois or unmanly Delawares, or shall they meet their friends with arms in their hands and robes on their backs?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 306000]), Text sample: They will look on their children with a dark eye, and say, 'Go! a Chippewa has come hither with the name of a Huron.' Brothers, we must not forget the dead; a red skin never ceases to remember.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 158880]), Text sample: We will load the back of this Mohican until he staggers under our bounty, and dispatch him after my young men.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 36240]), Text sample: Let this Delaware die."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74160]), Text sample: The quick and ready motion of the chief was not entirely too late.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 484320]), Text sample: Like their neighbors, they had followed Montcalm into the territories of the English crown, and were making heavy and serious inroads on the hunting grounds of the Mohawks; though they had seen fit, with the mysterious reserve so common among the natives, to withhold their assistance at the moment when it was most required.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 278160]), Text sample: As for the tribe itself, it had been content to announce to Montcalm, through his emissaries, with Indian brevity, that their hatchets were dull, and time was necessary to sharpen them.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 247920]), Text sample: The politic captain of the Canadas had deemed it wiser to submit to entertain a passive friend, than by any acts of ill judged severity to convert him into an open enemy.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147840]), Text sample: The chief extended his arm and taking the other by the wrist, they once more exchanged friendly salutations.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 273360]), Text sample: During the short and frugal repast that followed, the conversation was extremely circumspect, and related entirely to the events of the hunt, in which Magua had so lately been engaged.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 440880]), Text sample: It would have been impossible for the most finished breeding to wear more of the appearance of considering the visit as a thing of course, than did his hosts, notwithstanding every individual present was perfectly aware that it must be connected with some secret object and that probably of importance to themselves.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 160320]), Text sample: "Is the face of my great Canada father turned again toward his Huron children?" demanded the orator of the Delawares.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 161760]), Text sample: "It is so; but they are now bright and dull; for the Yengeese are dead, and the Delawares are our neighbors."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 119760]), Text sample: The other acknowledged the pacific compliment by a gesture of the hand, and remained silent.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 160320]), Text sample: Then Magua, as if recalled to such a recollection, by the allusion to the massacre, demanded:

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24000]), Text sample: "She is welcome."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 107520]), Text sample: "She is welcome," returned the chief of the latter nation, still more emphatically.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 247680]), Text sample: The baffled Magua continued silent several minutes, apparently indifferent, however, to the repulse he had received in this his opening effort to regain possession of Cora.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53760]), Text sample: Justice is the master of a red skin.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 217681]), Text sample: Why should they brighten their tomahawks and sharpen their knives against each other? Are not the pale faces thicker than the swallows in the season of flowers?"

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 166080]), Text sample: Magua waited a little, to permit his words to soften the feelings of the Delawares, before he added:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65759]), Text sample: Have not my brothers scented the feet of white men?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48479]), Text sample: "They will not find the Lenape asleep."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 165841]), Text sample: His nation would not go on the warpath, because they did not think it well, but their friends have remembered where they lived."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 212880]), Text sample: When he had thus announced his liberal intention, the crafty chief arose, and gravely spread his presents before the dazzled eyes of his hosts.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 146400]), Text sample: They consisted principally of trinkets of little value, plundered from the slaughtered females of William Henry.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 131039]), Text sample: In the division of the baubles the cunning Huron discovered no less art than in their selection.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 351121]), Text sample: While he bestowed those of greater value on the two most distinguished warriors, one of whom was his host, he seasoned his offerings to their inferiors with such well timed and apposite compliments, as left them no ground of complaint.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 365519]), Text sample: In short, the whole ceremony contained such a happy blending of the profitable with the flattering, that it was not difficult for the donor immediately to read the effect of a generosity so aptly mingled with praise, in the eyes of those he addressed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 153360]), Text sample: This well judged and politic stroke on the part of Magua was not without instantaneous results.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 362400]), Text sample: The Delawares lost their gravity in a much more cordial expression; and the host, in particular, after contemplating his own liberal share of the spoil for some moments with peculiar gratification, repeated with strong emphasis, the words:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45359]), Text sample: "My brother is a wise chief.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24721]), Text sample: He is welcome."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 95279]), Text sample: "The Hurons love their friends the Delawares," returned Magua.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 29039]), Text sample: "Why should they not?

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 61202]), Text sample: "There have been strange moccasins about my camp.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48000]), Text sample: They have been tracked into my lodges."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 22319]), Text sample: "It would not do.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 70800]), Text sample: Did not the Huron chief say he took women in the battle?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 178800]), Text sample: Then they fled to the Delawares-for, say they, the Delawares are our friends; their minds are turned from their Canada father!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 341280]), Text sample: The recent defection of the tribe had, as they well knew themselves, subjected the Delawares to much reproach among their French allies; and they were now made to feel that their future actions were to be regarded with jealousy and distrust.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 283199]), Text sample: Their distant villages, their hunting grounds and hundreds of their women and children, together with a material part of their physical force, were actually within the limits of the French territory.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 238081]), Text sample: Accordingly, this alarming annunciation was received, as Magua intended, with manifest disapprobation, if not with alarm.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 70801]), Text sample: When he is told a bloody Yengee smokes at your fire?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 108241]), Text sample: "Where is the Yengee that the Delawares fear?" returned the other; "who has slain my young men?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 55200]), Text sample: Who is the mortal enemy of my Great Father?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 227519]), Text sample: "A Huron never lies!" returned Magua, coldly, leaning his head against the side of the lodge, and drawing his slight robe across his tawny breast.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 141840]), Text sample: "Let the Delawares count their prisoners; they will find one whose skin is neither red nor pale."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48479]), Text sample: A long and musing pause succeeded.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 182642]), Text sample: The chief consulted apart with his companions, and messengers despatched to collect certain others of the most distinguished men of the tribe.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 122401]), Text sample: The news spread from mouth to mouth, until the whole encampment became powerfully agitated.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 164161]), Text sample: The women suspended their labors, to catch such syllables as unguardedly fell from the lips of the consulting warriors.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 343919]), Text sample: When the excitement had a little abated, the old men disposed themselves seriously to consider that which it became the honor and safety of their tribe to perform, under circumstances of so much delicacy and embarrassment.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 211919]), Text sample: He, therefore, left the lodge and walked silently forth to the place, in front of the encampment, whither the warriors were already beginning to collect.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 146162]), Text sample: It might have been half an hour before each individual, including even the women and children, was in his place.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72961]), Text sample: Its number somewhat exceeded a thousand souls.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 265919]), Text sample: Until such a one chose to make some movement, no deeds in arms, no natural gifts, nor any renown as an orator, would have justified the slightest interruption.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 259202]), Text sample: The delay had already continued long beyond the usual deliberative pause that always preceded a conference; but no sign of impatience or surprise escaped even the youngest boy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 346561]), Text sample: They were all aged, even beyond that period to which the oldest present had reached; but one in the center, who leaned on his companions for support, had numbered an amount of years to which the human race is seldom permitted to attain.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 362640]), Text sample: His dark, wrinkled countenance was in singular and wild contrast with the long white locks which floated on his shoulders, in such thickness, as to announce that generations had probably passed away since they had last been shorn.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 381121]), Text sample: The dress of this patriarch-for such, considering his vast age, in conjunction with his affinity and influence with his people, he might very properly be termed-was rich and imposing, though strictly after the simple fashions of the tribe.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 580561]), Text sample: His head, on the whole of which the hair had been permitted to grow, the pursuits of war having so long been abandoned, was encircled by a sort of plated diadem, which, in its turn, bore lesser and more glittering ornaments, that sparkled amid the glossy hues of three drooping ostrich feathers, dyed a deep black, in touching contrast to the color of his snow white locks.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 193919]), Text sample: The eyes of the old man were closed, as though the organs were wearied with having so long witnessed the selfish workings of the human passions.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 253682]), Text sample: After a suitable and decent pause, the principal chiefs arose, and, approaching the patriarch, they placed his hands reverently on their heads, seeming to entreat a blessing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 184802]), Text sample: In a few minutes they reappeared, escorting the individuals who had caused all these solemn preparations toward the seat of judgment.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 446160]), Text sample: Riverboro was doing its best to return the entire tribe of Simpsons to the land of its fathers, so to speak, thinking rightly that the town which had given them birth, rather than the town of their adoption, should feed them and keep a roof over their heads until the children were of an age for self support.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 178320]), Text sample: They were not exactly popular favorites, but they did receive certain undesirable morsels from the more charitable housewives.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 553440]), Text sample: Life was rather dull and dreary, however, and in the chill and gloom of November weather, with the vision of other people's turkeys bursting with fat, and other people's golden pumpkins and squashes and corn being garnered into barns, the young Simpsons groped about for some inexpensive form of excitement, and settled upon the selling of soap for a premium.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 258720]), Text sample: They had sold enough to their immediate neighbors during the earlier autumn to secure a child's handcart, which, though very weak on its pins, could be trundled over the country roads.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 387120]), Text sample: With large business sagacity and an executive capacity which must have been inherited from their father, they now proposed to extend their operations to a larger area and distribute soap to contiguous villages, if these villages could be induced to buy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 291120]), Text sample: It was at this juncture that Clara Belle and Susan Simpson consulted Rebecca, who threw herself solidly and wholeheartedly into the enterprise, promising her help and that of Emma Jane Perkins.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 198720]), Text sample: The premiums within their possible grasp were three: a bookcase, a plush reclining chair, and a banquet lamp.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 432480]), Text sample: It looked to be about eight feet tall in the catalogue, and Emma Jane advised Clara Belle to measure the height of the Simpson ceilings; but a note in the margin of the circular informed them that it stood two and a half feet high when set up in all its dignity and splendor on a proper table, three dollars extra.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 530400]), Text sample: It was only of polished brass, continued the circular, though it was invariably mistaken for solid gold, and the shade that accompanied it (at least it accompanied it if the agent sold a hundred extra cakes) was of crinkled crepe paper printed in a dozen delicious hues, from which the joy dazzled agent might take his choice.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 537360]), Text sample: Clara Belle was rather a successful agent, but Susan, who could only say "thoap," never made large returns, and the twins, who were somewhat young to be thoroughly trustworthy, could be given only a half dozen cakes at a time, and were obliged to carry with them on their business trips a brief document stating the price per cake, dozen, and box.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 401520]), Text sample: Rebecca and Emma Jane offered to go two or three miles in some one direction and see what they could do in the way of stirring up a popular demand for the Snow White and Rose Red brands, the former being devoted to laundry purposes and the latter being intended for the toilet.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 269520]), Text sample: They had the soap company's circular from which to arrange a proper speech, and they had, what was still better, the remembrance of a certain patent medicine vender's discourse at the Milltown Fair.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 151920]), Text sample: His method, when once observed, could never be forgotten; nor his manner, nor his vocabulary.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 100800]), Text sample: Emma Jane practiced it on Rebecca, and Rebecca on Emma Jane.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 208320]), Text sample: It is called the Snow White and Rose Red Soap, six cakes in an ornamental box, only twenty cents for the white, twenty five cents for the red.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 156480]), Text sample: It is made from the purest ingredients, and if desired could be eaten by an invalid with relish and profit."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 151440]), Text sample: "Oh, Rebecca, don't let's say that!" interposed Emma Jane hysterically. "It makes me feel like a fool."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 346080]), Text sample: "It takes so little to make you feel like a fool, Emma Jane," rebuked Rebecca, "that sometimes I think that you must BE one I don't get to feeling like a fool so awfully easy; now leave out that eating part if you don't like it, and go on."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 110640]), Text sample: "The Snow White is probably the most remarkable laundry soap ever manufactured.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 295920]), Text sample: Immerse the garments in a tub, lightly rubbing the more soiled portions with the soap; leave them submerged in water from sunset to sunrise, and then the youngest baby can wash them without the slightest effort."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 85200]), Text sample: "BABE, not baby," corrected Rebecca from the circular.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66480]), Text sample: "It's just the same thing," argued Emma Jane.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 195840]), Text sample: "Of course it's just the same THING; but a baby has got to be called babe or infant in a circular, the same as it is in poetry!

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 104160]), Text sample: "No," grumbled Emma Jane; "infant is worse even than babe.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 181440]), Text sample: Rebecca, do you think we'd better do as the circular says, and let Elijah or Elisha try the soap before we begin selling?"

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 146160]), Text sample: "No," answered Emma Jane after a long pause; "no, it don't; not a mite."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90000]), Text sample: "Perhaps dizzy isn't just the right word, but it's nearest.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74400]), Text sample: If you could be a tree, which one would you choose?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 319680]), Text sample: Emma Jane had enjoyed considerable experience of this kind, and Rebecca had succeeded in unstopping her ears, ungluing her eyes, and loosening her tongue, so that she could "play the game" after a fashion.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 22560]), Text sample: Rebecca laughed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 88319]), Text sample: "Then I could see so much more than your pink apple tree by the pig pen.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 396240]), Text sample: They did not accompany each other to the doors of their chosen victims, feeling sure that together they could not approach the subject seriously; but they parted at the gate of each house, the one holding the horse while the other took the soap samples and interviewed any one who seemed of a coming on disposition.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 399840]), Text sample: Emma Jane had disposed of three single cakes, Rebecca of three small boxes; for a difference in their ability to persuade the public was clearly defined at the start, though neither of them ascribed either success or defeat to anything but the imperious force of circumstances.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 188640]), Text sample: Housewives looked at Emma Jane and desired no soap; listened to her description of its merits, and still desired none.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 71280]), Text sample: Other stars in their courses governed Rebecca's doings.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 445200]), Text sample: The people whom she interviewed either remembered their present need of soap, or reminded themselves that they would need it in the future; the notable point in the case being that lucky Rebecca accomplished, with almost no effort, results that poor little Emma Jane failed to attain by hard and conscientious labor.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 228000]), Text sample: "It's your turn, Rebecca, and I'm glad, too," said Emma Jane, drawing up to a gateway and indicating a house that was set a considerable distance from the road.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 382560]), Text sample: "I haven't got over trembling from the last place yet." (A lady had put her head out of an upstairs window and called, "Go away, little girl; whatever you have in your box we don't want any.") "I don't know who lives here, and the blinds are all shut in front.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 112800]), Text sample: If there's nobody at home you mustn't count it, but take the next house as yours."

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 180480]), Text sample: There was a porch there, and seated in a rocking chair, husking corn, was a good looking young man, or was he middle aged?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 241200]), Text sample: Rebecca could not make up her mind. At all events he had an air of the city about him,--well shaven face, well trimmed mustache, well fitting clothes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 227760]), Text sample: Rebecca was a trifle shy at this unexpected encounter, but there was nothing to be done but explain her presence, so she asked, "Is the lady of the house at home?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 102000]), Text sample: "I am the lady of the house at present," said the stranger, with a whimsical smile.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 30960]), Text sample: "What can I do for you?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 155760]), Text sample: "Have you ever heard of the-would you like, or I mean-do you need any soap?" queried Rebecca.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 76800]), Text sample: "Do I look as if I did?" he responded unexpectedly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 28800]), Text sample: Rebecca dimpled.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 219120]), Text sample: "I didn't mean THAT; I have some soap to sell; I mean I would like to introduce to you a very remarkable soap, the best now on the market.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63840]), Text sample: "Made out of pure vegetable fats, isn't it?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58800]), Text sample: "The very purest," corroborated Rebecca.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 31440]), Text sample: "No acid in it?"

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 98400]), Text sample: "And yet a child could do the Monday washing with it and use no force."

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35040]), Text sample: "Oh! a babe, eh?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 113760]), Text sample: That child grows younger every year, instead of older-wise child!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 128640]), Text sample: This was great good fortune, to find a customer who knew all the virtues of the article in advance.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 172560]), Text sample: Rebecca dimpled more and more, and at her new friend's invitation sat down on a stool at his side near the edge of the porch.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 166320]), Text sample: Presently she forgot all about her silent partner at the gate and was talking as if she had known this grand personage all her life.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 102480]), Text sample: "I'm keeping house to day, but I don't live here," explained the delightful gentleman.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37200]), Text sample: "What was your worst trouble?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56880]), Text sample: "Lack of food and clothes principally."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 153360]), Text sample: "Oh!" exclaimed Rebecca sympathetically,--"mine was no shoes and too many babies and not enough books.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 92400]), Text sample: "I'm doing pretty well, thank you," said the man, with a delightful smile.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 83760]), Text sample: "Oh, I don't know about that; soap keeps, doesn't it?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 201840]), Text sample: "I'm not certain," said Rebecca conscientiously, "but I'll look in the circular-it's sure to tell;" and she drew the document from her pocket.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 92400]), Text sample: "What are you going to do with the magnificent profits you get from this business?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 264000]), Text sample: "We are not selling for our own benefit," said Rebecca confidentially. "My friend who is holding the horse at the gate is the daughter of a very rich blacksmith, and doesn't need any money.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67440]), Text sample: We are trying to get a premium for some friends of ours."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 142080]), Text sample: "You needn't argue that point," laughed the man, as he stood up to get a glimpse of the "rich blacksmith's daughter" at the gate.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 332640]), Text sample: "If they sell two hundred more cakes this month and next, they can have the lamp by Christmas," Rebecca answered, "and they can get a shade by summer time; but I'm afraid I can't help very much after to day, because my aunt Miranda may not like to have me."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 28560]), Text sample: "I see.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37680]), Text sample: Well, that's all right.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78480]), Text sample: I'll take three hundred cakes, and that will give them shade and all."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 241680]), Text sample: Rebecca had been seated on a stool very near to the edge of the porch, and at this remark she made a sudden movement, tipped over, and disappeared into a clump of lilac bushes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 165840]), Text sample: It was a very short distance, fortunately, and the amused capitalist picked her up, set her on her feet, and brushed her off.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 264000]), Text sample: "You should never seem surprised when you have taken a large order," said he; "you ought to have replied 'Can't you make it three hundred and fifty?' instead of capsizing in that unbusinesslike way."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 139200]), Text sample: "Oh, I could never say anything like that!" exclaimed Rebecca, who was blushing crimson at her awkward fall.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41760]), Text sample: Are you sure you can afford it?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 103200]), Text sample: "If I can't, I'll save on something else," returned the jocose philanthropist.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 91440]), Text sample: "What if your aunt shouldn't like the kind of soap?" queried Rebecca nervously.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53280]), Text sample: "Mine doesn't!" exclaimed Rebecca
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45120]), Text sample: "Then there's something wrong with your aunt!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46800]), Text sample: "Or with me," laughed Rebecca.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53760]), Text sample: "Rebecca Rowena Randall, sir."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51120]), Text sample: "What?" with an amused smile.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42960]), Text sample: Your mother was generous."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 88320]), Text sample: "I think I know already," answered Rebecca, with a bright glance.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 83040]), Text sample: She must be so tired waiting, and she will be so glad!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48480]), Text sample: Emma Jane! we are sold out!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 332880]), Text sample: mr Aladdin followed smilingly to corroborate this astonishing, unbelievable statement; lifted all their boxes from the back of the wagon, and taking the circular, promised to write to the Excelsior Company that night concerning the premium.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 332880]), Text sample: "If you could contrive to keep a secret,--you two little girls,--it would be rather a nice surprise to have the lamp arrive at the Simpsons' on Thanksgiving Day, wouldn't it?" he asked, as he tucked the old lap robe cosily over their feet.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82080]), Text sample: "Oh, don't mention it!" laughed mr Aladdin, lifting his hat.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147120]), Text sample: "I was a sort of commercial traveler myself once,--years ago,--and I like to see the thing well done.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45121]), Text sample: Good by Miss Rebecca Rowena!

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 136560]), Text sample: "He tucked the lap robe round us, too," continued Emma Jane, in an ecstasy of reminiscence.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63121]), Text sample: "Oh! isn't he perfectly elergant?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60720]), Text sample: And wasn't it lovely of him to buy us out?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 96479]), Text sample: And just think of having both the lamp and the shade for one day's work!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 133680]), Text sample: Aren't you glad you wore your pink gingham now, even if mother did make you put on flannel underneath?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 124560]), Text sample: You do look so pretty in pink and red, Rebecca, and so homely in drab and brown!"

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 210719]), Text sample: You wouldn't believe it, but I was a dreadful homely baby, and homely right along till just a year or two ago, when my red hair began to grow dark.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74160]), Text sample: "I never thought to ask!" ejaculated Rebecca.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 77280]), Text sample: But I called him mr Aladdin because he gave us a lamp.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 122640]), Text sample: "Oh, Rebecca! how could you call him a nickname the very first time you ever saw him?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 127681]), Text sample: "Aladdin isn't a nickname exactly; anyway, he laughed and seemed to like it."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 380880]), Text sample: By dint of superhuman effort, and putting such a seal upon their lips as never mortals put before, the two girls succeeded in keeping their wonderful news to themselves; although it was obvious to all beholders that they were in an extraordinary and abnormal state of mind.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 343199]), Text sample: Rebecca had heard the news of its arrival, but waited until nearly dark before asking permission to go to the Simpsons', so that she might see the gorgeous trophy lighted and sending a blaze of crimson glory through its red crepe paper shade.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 203760]), Text sample: THE RIVER!' just like that-the same as Eliza did in the play; then I leaped from puddle to puddle, and Living and Emma Jane pursued me like the bloodhounds.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 111840]), Text sample: And Eliza wasn't swearing when she said 'My God! the river!' It was more like praying."

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46320]), Text sample: "She doesn't look the least bit like him."

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 159360]), Text sample: Altogether she looked more as if she might be a big member of the Sparrow family than the wife of handsome Rosebreast.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 138000]), Text sample: While Rosebreast sang, mrs Grosbeak was very busily picking buds and blossoms from the tree.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72480]), Text sample: "What is she doing that for?" inquired peter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 142800]), Text sample: "For the same reason that you bite off sweet clover blossoms and leaves," replied Jenny Wren tartly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 153840]), Text sample: "Do you mean to say that they live on buds and blossoms?" cried peter. "I never heard of such a thing."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 109200]), Text sample: You can ask more silly questions than anybody of my acquaintance," retorted Jenny Wren.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 71280]), Text sample: "Of course they don't live on buds and blossoms.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 109440]), Text sample: If they did they would soon starve to death, for buds and blossoms don't last long.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 205200]), Text sample: You ask Farmer Brown's boy who helps him most in his potato patch, and he'll tell you it's the Grosbeaks. They certainly do love potato bugs.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 94800]), Text sample: At first peter had eyes only for the wonderful beauty of Redcoat.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 175440]), Text sample: Then quite suddenly it came over peter that something was wrong with Redcoat, and he hurried forward to see what the trouble might be.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 216720]), Text sample: Redcoat heard the rustle of Peter's feet among the dry leaves and at once began to flap and flutter in an effort to fly away, but he could not get off the ground.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 36480]), Text sample: It is just peter Rabbit.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67920]), Text sample: You don't have anything to fear from me," cried peter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 158160]), Text sample: The look of terror which had been in the eyes of Redcoat died out, and he stopped fluttering and simply lay panting.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 140400]), Text sample: "Oh, peter," he gasped, "you don't know how glad I am that it is only you.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 95280]), Text sample: I've had a terrible accident, and I don't know what I am to do.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 127680]), Text sample: I can't fly, and if I have to stay on the ground some enemy will be sure to get me.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 36240]), Text sample: What shall I do, peter?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52080]), Text sample: Right away peter was full of sympathy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 112080]), Text sample: "What kind of an accident was it, Redcoat, and how did it happen?" he asked.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 91200]), Text sample: "Broadwing the Hawk tried to catch me," sobbed Redcoat.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 146880]), Text sample: "In dodging him among the trees I was heedless for a moment and did not see just where I was going.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 126000]), Text sample: I struck a sharp pointed dead twig and drove it right through my right wing."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 177599]), Text sample: Redcoat held up his right wing and sure enough there was a little stick projecting from both sides close up to the shoulder.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 40320]), Text sample: The wing was bleeding a little.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 84480]), Text sample: "Oh, dear, whatever shall I do, peter Rabbit?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 71281]), Text sample: Whatever shall I do?" sobbed Redcoat.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63120]), Text sample: "Does it pain you dreadfully?" asked peter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24000]), Text sample: Redcoat nodded.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 80400]), Text sample: "But I don't mind the pain," he hastened to say.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 62640]), Text sample: "It is the thought of what MAY happen to me."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99120]), Text sample: She was dressed almost wholly in light olive green and greenish yellow.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 116160]), Text sample: She looked no more like beautiful Redcoat than did mrs Grosbeak like Rosebreast.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 122399]), Text sample: "Can't you fly up just a little way so as to get off the ground?" she cried anxiously.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 81600]), Text sample: "Isn't it dreadful, peter Rabbit, to have such an accident?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 137760]), Text sample: We've just got our nest half built, and I don't know what I shall do if anything happens to Redcoat.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 181920]), Text sample: Hide!" mrs Tanager flew off a short distance to one side and began to cry as if in the greatest distress.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 158879]), Text sample: Poor Redcoat, with the old look of terror in his eyes, fluttered along, trying to find something under which to hide.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 70320]), Text sample: "Don't be afraid, Redcoat," he whispered.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 252000]), Text sample: "It's Farmer Brown's boy and I'm sure he won't hurt you. Perhaps he can help you." Then peter scampered off for a short distance and sat up to watch what would happen.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60721]), Text sample: Of coarse Farmer Brown's boy saw Redcoat.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 123118]), Text sample: No one with any eyes at all could have helped seeing him, because of that wonderful scarlet coat.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 162719]), Text sample: Farmer Brown's boy understood instantly that something was wrong with one wing, and running forward, he caught Redcoat.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 36000]), Text sample: "You poor little thing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 213841]), Text sample: You poor, beautiful little creature," said Farmer Brown's boy softly as he saw the cruel twig sticking through Redcoats' shoulder.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 163440]), Text sample: "We'll have to get that out right away," continued Farmer Brown's boy, stroking Redcoat ever so gently.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 153840]), Text sample: Somehow at that gentle touch Redcoat lost much of his fear, and a little hope sprang in his heart.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 186719]), Text sample: Then, doing his best to be careful and to hurt as little as possible, he worked the other part of the twig out from the under side.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 86160]), Text sample: Carefully he examined the wing to see if any bones were broken.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 170401]), Text sample: None were, and after holding Redcoat a few minutes he carefully set him up in a tree and withdrew a short distance.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 97440]), Text sample: Redcoat hopped from branch to branch until he was halfway up the tree.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 300720]), Text sample: Then he sat there for some time as if fearful of trying that injured wing. Meanwhile mrs Tanager came and fussed about him and talked to him and coaxed him and made as much of him as if he were a baby.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 218160]), Text sample: "I knew Farmer Brown's boy would help him, and I'm so glad he found him," cried peter happily and started for the dear Old Briar patch.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 282000]), Text sample: Thenardier had just passed his fiftieth birthday; Madame Thenardier was approaching her forties, which is equivalent to fifty in a woman; so that there existed a balance of age between husband and wife.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24960]), Text sample: She had a beard.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 125760]), Text sample: She swore splendidly; she boasted of being able to crack a nut with one blow of her fist.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 234480]), Text sample: His cunning began here; he smiled habitually, by way of precaution, and was almost polite to everybody, even to the beggar to whom he refused half a farthing.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 306480]), Text sample: He composed the travellers' tariff card in a superior manner, but practised eyes sometimes spied out orthographical errors in it. Thenardier was cunning, greedy, slothful, and clever.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 76800]), Text sample: Emil's ship is lost, and as yet no news of him.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 154560]), Text sample: Tidings had been sent to the shipowners at Hamburg by some of the survivors, and telegraphed at once by Franz to his uncle.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 161040]), Text sample: Mrs Jo refused to believe it, stoutly insisting that Emil would outlive any storm and yet turn up safe and gay.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 165600]), Text sample: Teddy stood on his head literally, and tore about the neighbourhood on Octoo, like a second Paul Revere-only his tidings were good.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 210960]), Text sample: There was great scrubbing and dusting among the matrons as they set their houses in order not only for Class Day, but to receive the bride and groom, who were to come to them for the honeymoon trip.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 106800]), Text sample: Yet his success was far greater than Nat's, though only God and one good man saw it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 268320]), Text sample: When he thought of it Dan felt as if he could not wait, but must burst that narrow cell and fly away, as the caddis worms he used to watch by the brookside shed their stony coffins, to climb the ferns and soar into the sky.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35041]), Text sample: I must get over this first.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 190800]), Text sample: A few days after Chebec and his wife started building their nest in the Old Orchard peter dropped around as usual for a very early call.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 266160]), Text sample: He found Chebec very busy hunting for materials for that nest, because, as he explained to peter, mrs Chebec is very particular indeed about what her nest is made of.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63120]), Text sample: But he had time to tell peter a bit of news.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 235440]), Text sample: "My fighting cousin and my handsomest cousin arrived together yesterday, and now our family is very well represented in the Old Orchard," said Chebec proudly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 182640]), Text sample: Slowly peter reached over his back with his long left hind foot and thoughtfully scratched his long right ear.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99840]), Text sample: He didn't like to admit that he couldn't recall those two cousins of Chebec's.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 86400]), Text sample: "Did you say your fighting cousin?" he asked in a hesitating way.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 75120]), Text sample: "He is Scrapper the Kingbird, as of course you know.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 62640]), Text sample: The rest of us always feel safe when he is about."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 165120]), Text sample: Of course, peter couldn't be left out of anything like that, and he scampered for the scene of trouble as fast as his legs could take him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 96960]), Text sample: For a minute peter couldn't think what was the trouble with Redtail, and then he saw.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 146160]), Text sample: He was just a little smaller than Welcome Robin, and in comparison with him Redtail was a perfect giant.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 92160]), Text sample: But this seemed to make no difference to Scrapper, for that is who it was.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 81600]), Text sample: It is because of his fearlessness that he is called Kingbird.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 127680]), Text sample: But none, not even Bully the English Sparrow, was brave enough to join him in attacking big Redtail.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 305040]), Text sample: When he had succeeded in driving Redtail far enough from the Old Orchard to suit him, Scrapper flew back and perched on a dead branch of one of the trees, where he received the congratulations of all his feathered neighbors.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 228240]), Text sample: He took them quite modestly, assuring them that he had done nothing, nothing at all, but that he didn't intend to have any of the Hawk family around the Old Orchard while he lived there.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 71520]), Text sample: peter couldn't help but admire Scrapper for his courage.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 228240]), Text sample: While peter sat staring up at him Scrapper suddenly darted out into the air, and his bill snapped in quite the same way Chebec's did when he caught a fly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23760]), Text sample: It was a bee.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 62400]), Text sample: "Do you live on bees altogether?" asked peter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90240]), Text sample: "Bless your heart, peter, no," replied Scrapper with a chuckle.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52800]), Text sample: "There wouldn't be any honey if I did.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35280]), Text sample: They do no work at all.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 85440]), Text sample: peter knew better than to waste any effort trying to see that fly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 108720]), Text sample: He knew that he couldn't have seen it had it been only one fourth that distance away.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72000]), Text sample: "Are you going to build in the Old Orchard this year?" asked peter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47760]), Text sample: "Of course I am," declared Scrapper.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 5520]), Text sample: "I-"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 212400]), Text sample: Blacky saw him coming and was wise enough to suddenly appear to have no interest whatever in the Old Orchard, turning away toward the Green Meadows instead.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 50880]), Text sample: peter didn't wait for Scrapper to return.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 97200]), Text sample: Just as he was leaving the far corner of the Old Orchard some one called him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 18480]), Text sample: "peter!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56880]), Text sample: Oh, peter Rabbit!" called the voice.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 201360]), Text sample: peter stopped abruptly, sat up very straight, looked this way, looked that way and looked the other way, every way but the right way.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 87360]), Text sample: "Look up over your head," cried the voice, rather a harsh voice.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67440]), Text sample: It was Cresty the Great Crested Flycatcher.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 166800]), Text sample: He was a wee bit bigger than Scrapper the Kingbird, yet not quite so big as Welcome Robin, and more slender.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 95520]), Text sample: His throat and breast were gray, shading into bright yellow underneath.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 92640]), Text sample: A pointed cap was all that was needed to make him quite distinguished looking.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 109680]), Text sample: He certainly was the handsomest as well as the largest of the Flycatcher family.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57360]), Text sample: "I just want to ask one little favor of you."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 101760]), Text sample: "What is it?" asked peter, who is always glad to do any one a favor.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147600]), Text sample: "A cast off suit of clothes from any member of the Snake family," replied Cresty somewhat impatiently.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35520]), Text sample: "Now don't forget, peter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 199680]), Text sample: I've got to go house hunting, but you'll find me there or hereabouts, if it happens that you find one of those cast off Snake suits."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 80160]), Text sample: Before peter could say another word Cresty had flown away.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 140400]), Text sample: peter hesitated, looking first towards the dear Old Briar patch and then towards Jenny Wren's house.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 165600]), Text sample: He just couldn't understand about those cast off suits of the Snake family, and he felt sure that Jenny Wren could tell him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 181920]), Text sample: Finally curiosity got the best of him, and back he scampered, lipperty lipperty lip, to the foot of the tree in which Jenny Wren had her home.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 29760]), Text sample: "Jenny!" called peter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23520]), Text sample: "Jenny Wren!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 186720]), Text sample: Jenny Wren!" No one answered him. He could hear mr Wren singing in another tree, but he couldn't see him. "Jenny!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 94080]), Text sample: This time Jenny popped her head out, and her little eyes fairly snapped.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 102480]), Text sample: "Didn't I tell you the other day, peter Rabbit, that I'm not to be disturbed?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 25680]), Text sample: Didn't I, peter Rabbit?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33600]), Text sample: Didn't I? Didn't I?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 96240]), Text sample: You certainly did, and I'm sorry to disturb you," replied peter meekly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46320]), Text sample: "Snake skins," replied peter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44399]), Text sample: Snake skins!" shrieked Jenny Wren.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 13200]), Text sample: Ugh!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53760]), Text sample: "You don't understand," cried peter hurriedly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 212159]), Text sample: "What I want to know is, why should Cresty the Flycatcher ask me to please let him know if I found any cast off suits of the Snake family?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 204480]), Text sample: He flew away before I could ask him why he wants them, and so I came to you, because I know you know everything, especially everything concerning your neighbors."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 102240]), Text sample: Jenny Wren looked as if she didn't know whether to feel flattered or provoked.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20640]), Text sample: CHAPTER eight.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 156480]), Text sample: On his way he couldn't resist the temptation to run over to the Green Forest, which was just beyond the Old Orchard.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 97680]), Text sample: Hardly had he reached it when he heard a plaintive voice crying, "Pee wee!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56160]), Text sample: Pee wee!" peter chuckled happily.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 76320]), Text sample: "He usually is one of the last of the Flycatcher family to arrive.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46080]), Text sample: I didn't expect to find him yet.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58320]), Text sample: I wonder what has brought him up so early."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 160080]), Text sample: It ended just where it had started, on a dead twig of a tree in a shady, rather lonely part of the Green Forest.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 105360]), Text sample: Almost at once he began to call his name in a rather sad, plaintive tone, "Pee wee! Pee wee!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 15360]), Text sample: Pee wee!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67200]), Text sample: But he wasn't sad, as peter well knew.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 62640]), Text sample: It was his way of expressing how happy he felt.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 111360]), Text sample: He was a little bigger than his cousin, Chebec, but looked very much like him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 96960]), Text sample: The upper half of his bill was black, but the lower half was light.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 22080]), Text sample: Pewee nodded.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 103200]), Text sample: "If you please," peter inquired politely, "why do folks call you Wood Pewee?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32880]), Text sample: Pewee chuckled happily.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64800]), Text sample: It is so quiet and restful that I love it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56400]), Text sample: mrs Pewee and I are very retiring.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45600]), Text sample: "Come as often as you like," replied Pewee.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 469680]), Text sample: Back in the Old Briar patch peter thought over all he had learned about the Flycatcher family, and as he recalled how they were forever catching all sorts of flying insects it suddenly struck him that they must be very useful little people in helping Old Mother Nature take care of her trees and other growing things which insects so dearly love to destroy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 260880]), Text sample: But most of all peter thought about that queer request of Cresty's, and a dozen times that day he found himself peeping under old logs in the hope of finding a cast off coat of mr Black Snake.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 266160]), Text sample: It was such a funny thing for Cresty to ask for that Peter's curiosity would allow him no peace, and the next morning he was up in the Old Orchard before jolly mr Sun had kicked his bedclothes off.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 61440]), Text sample: Jenny couldn't keep her tongue still if she wanted to.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 84240]), Text sample: "Did you find any old clothes of the Snake family?" she demanded.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49920]), Text sample: "Why they want it, goodness knows!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65040]), Text sample: Perhaps they think it will scare robbers away.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 13200]), Text sample: Ugh!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 59280]), Text sample: "By the way, where does Cresty build?" asked peter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 55920]), Text sample: peter looked quite as surprised as he felt.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45600]), Text sample: "Does Cresty make the hole?" he asked.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43200]), Text sample: "Where are your eyes, peter?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 168000]), Text sample: Did you ever see a Flycatcher with a bill that looked as if it could cut wood?" She didn't wait for a reply, but rattled on.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 12000]), Text sample: Look!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 19920]), Text sample: That's good.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 31440]), Text sample: I like to see that.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 149760]), Text sample: But the Woodpeckers seem to like new houses best, which, as I said before, is a very good thing for the rest of us."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37680]), Text sample: peter grinned and looked foolish.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 55200]), Text sample: "And Skimmer the Tree Swallow," added Jenny.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34320]), Text sample: Again Jenny Wren nodded.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 165360]), Text sample: Yellow Wing the flicker, who really is a Woodpecker, often uses an old house, but quite often makes a new one.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 106800]), Text sample: Then there are Killy the Sparrow Hawk and Spooky the Screech Owl."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 30480]), Text sample: peter looked surprised.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72240]), Text sample: "They certainly do, more's the pity!" snapped Jenny.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 114000]), Text sample: But they do, and an old house of Yellow Wing the Flicker suits either of them.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47280]), Text sample: I've talked quite enough for one morning."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64080]), Text sample: Jenny paused and jerked her tail impatiently.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43920]), Text sample: "Have you got two homes?" asked peter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 55920]), Text sample: "What do you suppose I want of two homes?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44160]), Text sample: One is all I can take care of."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65520]), Text sample: Jenny Wren's eyes twinkled, and she laughed softly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 113760]), Text sample: "mr Wren just has to be busy about something, bless his heart," said she.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 80400]), Text sample: He's building that nest to take up his time and keep out of mischief.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 136080]), Text sample: peter scratched a long ear with a long hind foot, trying to think of some place to go.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42000]), Text sample: "That's where I'll go!" exclaimed peter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 121440]), Text sample: I'll just run over and pay my respects to Grandfather Frog, and to Redwing the Blackbird.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 102720]), Text sample: Redwing was one of the first birds to arrive, and I've neglected him shamefully."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78240]), Text sample: When peter thinks of something to do he wastes no time.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 86640]), Text sample: Off he started, lipperty lipperty lip, for the Smiling Pool.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 254160]), Text sample: He kept close to the edge of the Green Forest until he reached the place where the Laughing Brook comes out of the Green Forest on its way to the Smiling Pool in the Green Meadows.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 105600]), Text sample: Bushes and young trees grow along the banks of the Laughing Brook at this point.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66240]), Text sample: The ground was soft in places, quite muddy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 100560]), Text sample: peter doesn't mind getting his feet damp, so he hopped along carelessly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 112080]), Text sample: From right under his very nose something shot up into the air with a whistling sound.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 108240]), Text sample: It startled peter so that he stopped short with his eyes popping out of his head.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 129600]), Text sample: He had just a glimpse of a brown form disappearing over the tops of some tall bushes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 29280]), Text sample: Then peter chuckled.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 38640]), Text sample: He scared me for a second."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 28080]), Text sample: "You scared him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52320]), Text sample: I saw you coming, but Longbill didn't."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41280]), Text sample: peter turned quickly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 101040]), Text sample: There was mrs Woodcock peeping at him from behind a tussock of grass.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57360]), Text sample: "I didn't mean to scare him," apologized peter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 36000]), Text sample: "I really didn't mean to.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63360]), Text sample: Do you think he was really very much scared?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 127440]), Text sample: "Not too scared to come back, anyway," said Longbill himself, dropping down just in front of peter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 158400]), Text sample: I am glad it is no one but you, peter, for I was having a splendid meal here, and I should have hated to leave it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66240]), Text sample: You'll excuse me while I go on eating, I hope.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41040]), Text sample: We can talk between bites."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74880]), Text sample: But peter couldn't see a thing that looked good to eat.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 70560]), Text sample: There wasn't even a bug or a worm crawling on the ground.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 110160]), Text sample: Longbill took two or three steps in rather a stately fashion.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63360]), Text sample: But his bill was long enough to make up.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 172560]), Text sample: His back was a mixture of gray, brown, black and buff, while his breast and under parts were a beautiful reddish buff.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56640]), Text sample: It was his head that made him look queer.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 190080]), Text sample: His eyes were very big and they were set so far back that peter wondered if it wasn't easier for him to look behind him than in front of him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 62880]), Text sample: Suddenly Longbill plunged his bill into the ground.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53760]), Text sample: He plunged it in for the whole length.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 135360]), Text sample: Then he pulled it out and peter caught a glimpse of the tail end of a worm disappearing down Longbill's throat.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45120]), Text sample: "mrs Woodcock made some of them."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 105600]), Text sample: "And was there a worm in every one?" asked peter, his eyes very wide with interest.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 26400]), Text sample: Longbill nodded.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 255600]), Text sample: But the worms Welcome Robin got were always close to the surface, while these worms were so deep in the earth that peter couldn't understand how it was possible for any one to know that they were there.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 249600]), Text sample: See here!" Longbill suddenly thrust his bill straight out in front of him and to Peter's astonishment he lifted the end of the upper half without opening the rest of his bill at all.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46560]), Text sample: "That's the way I get them," said he.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 126720]), Text sample: "I can feel them when I reach them, and then I just open the top of my bill and grab them.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 181920]), Text sample: I think there is one right under my feet now; watch me get him." Longbill bored into the ground until his head was almost against it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 70080]), Text sample: When he pulled his bill out, sure enough, there was a worm.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 107760]), Text sample: "Of course," explained Longbill, "it is only in soft ground that I can do this.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 96960]), Text sample: That is why I have to fly away south as soon as the ground freezes at all."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32640]), Text sample: "It's wonderful," sighed peter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 86880]), Text sample: "I don't suppose any one else can find hidden worms that way."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 79680]), Text sample: "My cousin, Jack Snipe, can," replied Longbill promptly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20880]), Text sample: peter nodded.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 30960]), Text sample: "I do," said he.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 160080]), Text sample: "Now you speak of it, there is a strong family resemblance, although I hadn't thought of him as a relative of yours before.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 109680]), Text sample: I'm ever so glad to have seen you, and I'm coming over to call again the first chance I get."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 112800]), Text sample: So peter said good by and kept on down the Laughing Brook to the Smiling Pool.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 128160]), Text sample: Right where the Laughing Brook entered the Smiling Pool there was a little pebbly beach.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 307920]), Text sample: Running along the very edge of the water was a slim, trim little bird with fairly long legs, a long slender bill, brownish gray back with black spots and markings, and a white waistcoat neatly spotted with black.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 310320]), Text sample: Every few steps he would stop to pick up something, then stand for a second bobbing up and down in the funniest way, as if his body was so nicely balanced on his legs that it teetered back and forth like a seesaw.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 80400]), Text sample: It was Teeter the Spotted Sandpiper, an old friend of Peter's.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35520]), Text sample: peter greeted him joyously.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 13440]), Text sample: "Peet weet!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 129120]), Text sample: Peet weet!" cried Teeter, turning towards peter and bobbing and bowing as only Teeter can.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 173760]), Text sample: Before peter could say another word Teeter came running towards him, and it was plain to see that Teeter was very anxious about something.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24480]), Text sample: "Don't move, peter Rabbit!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 26640]), Text sample: Don't move!" he cried.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 130080]), Text sample: "Why not?" demanded peter, for he could see no danger and could think of no reason why he shouldn't move.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 108960]), Text sample: Just then mrs Teeter came hurrying up and squatted down in the sand right in front of peter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68160]), Text sample: "Thank goodness!" exclaimed Teeter, still bobbing and bowing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 93360]), Text sample: "If you had taken another step, peter Rabbit, you would have stepped right on our eggs.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 36960]), Text sample: You gave me a dreadful start."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23280]), Text sample: peter was puzzled.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78000]), Text sample: He showed it as he stared down at mrs Teeter just in front of him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99120]), Text sample: "I don't see any nest or eggs or anything," said he rather testily.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57360]), Text sample: mrs Teeter stood up and stepped aside.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 206160]), Text sample: Then peter saw right in a little hollow in the sand, with just a few bits of grass for a lining, four white eggs with big dark blotches on them.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60960]), Text sample: peter hastily backed away a few steps.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 102240]), Text sample: mrs Teeter slipped back on the eggs and settled herself comfortably.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 122159]), Text sample: It suddenly struck peter that if he hadn't seen her do it, he wouldn't have known she was there.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43678]), Text sample: mrs Teeter chuckled softly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 163678]), Text sample: The only time they are in danger is when somebody comes along, as you did, and is likely to step on them without seeing them.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41762]), Text sample: But that doesn't happen often."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67440]), Text sample: THE NATIVE INHABITANTS OF THE PACIFIC SLOPE
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 142320]), Text sample: The explorers and early settlers found a native race occupying nearly every portion of our continent.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 112560]), Text sample: These people had many characteristics in common and were all called Indians.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 295440]), Text sample: It is believed that they came originally from Asia, but their migration and scattering occurred so long ago that they have become divided into many groups, each having its own language and customs.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 509760]), Text sample: In the western portion of the country, where the surface is broken by numerous barriers, such as mountains and deserts, almost every valley was found to be occupied by a distinct group of Indians called a "tribe." The language of each tribe differed so much from the languages of adjoining tribes that they could with difficulty understand one another.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 70560]), Text sample: These tribes were almost continually at war.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 214080]), Text sample: The Indians upon the Pacific slope were generally found to be inferior in most respects to those living in the central and eastern portions of the continent.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 246720]), Text sample: One might suppose that the tribes possessing the fair and fertile valleys of California would be the most advanced in civilization, but such was not the case.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 80640]), Text sample: Many of them were among the most degraded upon the continent.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 199440]), Text sample: They seemed unable to adapt themselves to the white man and his ways, and in the older settled districts they have now nearly disappeared.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 281760]), Text sample: In the newer portions of the Northwest and along the coast toward Alaska the Indians have not yet come into so direct contact with the white men, and remain more nearly in their primitive condition.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 227760]), Text sample: When the Indians of central California were first seen, they wore but little clothing, and knew how to construct only the simplest dwellings for protection from the weather.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 143520]), Text sample: They did not cultivate the soil, nor did they hunt a great deal, although the country abounded with game.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 126480]), Text sample: The acorns were ground in stone mortars and made into soup or into a kind of bread.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 203520]), Text sample: It would seem natural that about San Francisco Bay the natives should have used canoes, but, according to early travellers, they had none.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 141120]), Text sample: When they wished to go out upon the water they built rafts of bundles of rushes or tules tied together.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 286320]), Text sample: At favorable points along the shore the Indians collected for their feasts, and these spots are now indicated by heaps of shells, in some places forming mounds of considerable size.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147360]), Text sample: Many interesting implements have been dug from these mounds, or kitchen middens as they are sometimes called.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 330960]), Text sample: In the mountains the sites of the villages are marked by chips of obsidian (a volcanic glass used in making arrow tips) and by holes in the flat surfaces of granitic rocks near some spring or stream.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90000]), Text sample: These holes were made for the purpose of grinding acorns or nuts.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 172080]), Text sample: Many of the Indian tribes developed great skill in the weaving of baskets, which they used for many different purposes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 122160]), Text sample: The baskets are still made in some places, and are much sought after because of their beauty.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 268800]), Text sample: The Indians of northern California in building their homes dug round, shallow holes, over which poles were bent in the form of a half circle, and then tied together at the top.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 111600]), Text sample: Bark was laid upon the outside, and earth was thrown over the whole structure.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 121200]), Text sample: "Sweat houses" were built in much the same manner, and were used chiefly during the winter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 298320]), Text sample: When an Indian wished to take a sweat, hot stones were placed in one of these houses, and after he had entered and all openings were closed, he poured water upon the stones until the room was filled with steam.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 179760]), Text sample: After enduring this process as long as he desired, the Indian came out and plunged into the cold water of a near by stream.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147600]), Text sample: As may be imagined, such a bath often resulted disastrously to the weak or sick.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 392160]), Text sample: The fact that the California Indians could support themselves without any great exertion undoubtedly had the effect of making them indolent, while in the desert regions of the Great Basin the struggle for something to eat was so severe that it kept the natives in a degraded condition.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 180240]), Text sample: Where wood was abundant their homes were similar in some respects to those of the coast Indians north of the mouth of the Columbia.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57600]), Text sample: Fish was their main article of diet.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 101040]), Text sample: After being partly dried they were packed in bales for winter use.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 174960]), Text sample: The fish thus prepared were considered very valuable and formed an article of trade with the tribes living farther from the river.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 186480]), Text sample: The Indians inhabiting the coast northward from the mouth of the Columbia were different in many respects from those farther south or inland.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 267120]), Text sample: They built better homes, took more pains with their clothing, were skilled in the making of canoes, and showed marked ability in navigating the stormy waters of the channels and sounds.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 155040]), Text sample: The Vancouver Island Indians are called Nootkas, from the name of an important tribe upon the west coast.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48960]), Text sample: These two groups are very similar.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 135120]), Text sample: They live upon the shores of densely wooded, mountainous lands and travel little except by water.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 192960]), Text sample: Some of the canoes which these tribes construct are over fifty feet long and will easily carry from fifty to one hundred persons.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 179280]), Text sample: Such a canoe is hewn out of a single cedar log, and presents a very graceful appearance with its upward curving bow.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 96000]), Text sample: In these boats the Indians take trips of hundreds of miles.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 376560]), Text sample: A ride in one of the large canoes is an interesting experience. When a party starts out to visit the neighboring villages, carrying invitations to a festival, the men are gayly dressed, and shout and sing in unison as they ply their paddles.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 238320]), Text sample: The great canoe jumps up and onward like a living thing at every stroke of the paddles, which are dipped into the water all at once as the rowers keep time to their songs.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 105840]), Text sample: These Indians, as might be supposed, live largely upon fish.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 441360]), Text sample: Berries are abundant during the summer and are also much used for food. The clothing of the Indians was originally a sort of blanket made of the woven fibres of cedar bark, or more rarely, of the skins of animals, although among the northern tribes skins were used almost exclusively.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 193200]), Text sample: This deformity is produced by binding a piece of board upon the forehead in babyhood and leaving it there while the head is growing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 116640]), Text sample: The villages are located in some protected spot where the canoes can lie in safety.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 162480]), Text sample: The buildings are strung along the shore close under the edge of the thick forest and just above the reach of the waves at high tide.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 202320]), Text sample: They are very solidly constructed, for these Indians do not move about as much as those farther south where the forests are less dense.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 108000]), Text sample: This is sometimes two feet in diameter and from sixty to eighty feet long.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 124081]), Text sample: It must require the united strength of many men to roll such a log into position.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 162721]), Text sample: Upon the framework thus constructed split cedar boards are fastened, and the building is practically finished.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 86159]), Text sample: Such a house is usually occupied by a number of families.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 145200]), Text sample: Upon Queen Charlotte Islands there is a dwelling of this kind large enough to hold seven hundred Indians.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 87601]), Text sample: The fronts of the houses are ornamented with figures hewn out of wood.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 120721]), Text sample: These represent men, birds and animals and have a religious significance.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 93361]), Text sample: Sometimes these figures are mounted upon the tops of tall poles.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68639]), Text sample: The "totem pole" is a most interesting affair.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63600]), Text sample: It is one of the finest upon the north coast.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 225360]), Text sample: The figures of animals and birds carved upon it represent the mythological ancestors of the family or clan in front of whose abode the pole stands.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 234481]), Text sample: The Indians often hunt similar animals to day, but believe that their ancestors had supernatural power which raised them above the ordinary creatures.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72240]), Text sample: The Chinook Indians live upon the lower Columbia.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 214560]), Text sample: The name "chinook" has been given to a warm, dry wind which blows down the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains and out upon the Great Plains.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 127200]), Text sample: This wind is so named because it blows from the direction of the Chinook Indians' country.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 160798]), Text sample: The "Chinook" jargon is a strange sort of mixed language with which nearly all the tribes of the Northwest are familiar.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 198241]), Text sample: It is formed of words from the Chinook language, together with others from different Indian languages, French Canadian, and English.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 265202]), Text sample: Through the influence of the trappers and traders the "Chinook" has come into wide use, so that by means of it conversation can be carried on with tribes speaking different languages.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 205680]), Text sample: Although there are so many different tribes, with great diversities of language, throughout the West, they were probably all derived from the same source.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 165359]), Text sample: As we go north the similarity between the coast Indians and the inhabitants of eastern Asia becomes more noticeable.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 198719]), Text sample: It seems almost certain that these American Indians originally came across the narrow strip of water separating Asia from America.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 159601]), Text sample: We do not know how long the Indians have occupied our country, but it has probably been several thousand years.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53040]), Text sample: The Mice will all be out sooner or later.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 76320]), Text sample: Let's go over and sit in that old oak on the edge of the meadow!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54240]), Text sample: Simon Screecher was more than willing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52800]), Text sample: Solomon Owl stopped him quickly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 59520]), Text sample: "Don't do that!" he said sharply.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 144240]), Text sample: "Do you want to scare the Mice?" Simon Screecher cut his whistle off right in the middle of it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53280]), Text sample: "I forgot," he murmured.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 176880]), Text sample: I don't think there are many Mice left on Farmer Green's place. It's my opinion that they've moved away-most of them.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 85200]), Text sample: Or maybe old Rough leg, the Hawk, has caught more than his share.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46800]), Text sample: He was a person of few words.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78480]), Text sample: If anybody asked his opinion he was ready to give it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 76320]), Text sample: But he seldom gave any unsought advice.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 138000]), Text sample: "I've about made up my mind," said Simon Screecher, "that I'd move to some other neighborhood.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 85440]), Text sample: If I knew where there was good mousing I'd move to morrow."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 98160]), Text sample: While he was speaking, Solomon Owl started ever so slightly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 84000]), Text sample: At that moment his cousin began to whistle again.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 75120]), Text sample: "Be quiet!" Solomon Owl thundered.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 59760]), Text sample: "If I'm not mistaken I heard a squeak.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 91200]), Text sample: But no Meadow Mouse will ever venture out of doors if you're going to whistle."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89520]), Text sample: "I forgot," said Simon Screecher once more.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 141600]), Text sample: "That's the reason why you can't catch more Mice," Solomon Owl snapped; for he was angry.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 76800]), Text sample: But of course you can't surprise them if you tell them you're coming.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68640]), Text sample: Simon Screecher was silenced for the time being.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 79200]), Text sample: And it wasn't long before Solomon Owl gave another start.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 61200]), Text sample: "There's that squeak again!" he whispered.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 50400]), Text sample: "I believe it is getting nearer, too."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 133440]), Text sample: Now, Master Meadow Mouse had a tunnel that led right beneath the tree where the two cousins were sitting.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 170640]), Text sample: And he had strolled that way after scurrying under the snow when he heard Solomon Owl laughing in the woods earlier in the evening.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51600]), Text sample: It was he that Solomon heard.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 138480]), Text sample: It was he that stuck his head out of a hole in the snow and peeped up at the star sprinkled sky.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 94800]), Text sample: And he dived out of the old oak straight at Master Meadow Mouse.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 166320]), Text sample: "I didn't suppose that chap would be here as soon as this," he gasped. "He must have hurried over here from the woods.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42720]), Text sample: He must be very hungry."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60960]), Text sample: "Missed him-didn't you?" he inquired.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 19440]), Text sample: "Yes!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74400]), Text sample: "Why didn't you grab him out of the snow?" Simon asked.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 38400]), Text sample: "What are your claws for?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32640]), Text sample: What's your beak for?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78000]), Text sample: "I couldn't dig him out," Solomon Owl replied.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39360]), Text sample: "The snow is three feet deep.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82320]), Text sample: And it has seven different crusts, one under another."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 71280]), Text sample: "This is a hard winter," said Simon Screecher.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52560]), Text sample: "I wish I'd gone South last fall.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 117360]), Text sample: AS SIMON SCREECHER remarked to his cousin, Solomon Owl, it was a hard winter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 30000]), Text sample: The snow was deep.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32640]), Text sample: The days were cold.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32880]), Text sample: And the nights were colder.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66480]), Text sample: And, worst of all, food became scarce.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 221280]), Text sample: It seemed as if there wasn't anything to eat anywhere except at the farm buildings, which Farmer Green had stuffed full of hay and grain during the summer and autumn.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 193920]), Text sample: Many of the forest folk stole down from Blue Mountain after nightfall and visited the farmyard in the hope of getting a bite of something or other.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52080]), Text sample: He had stored away a stock of food.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42480]), Text sample: But it hadn't been big enough.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46800]), Text sample: And that was a great mistake.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 107760]), Text sample: Master Meadow Mouse promised himself that he would not repeat it another time.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 132000]), Text sample: Unfortunately, all the promises in the world wouldn't give him a square meal when he needed one.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 86880]), Text sample: "This is my first winter," Master Meadow Mouse explained.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54000]), Text sample: "That's easy," his cousin answered.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 124080]), Text sample: "Get more!" And then he hurried away, for he had important business to attend to.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 102240]), Text sample: It was hard to follow his cousin through the winding galleries beneath the snow.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 186480]), Text sample: Several times Master Meadow Mouse took the wrong turn and had to retrace his steps. But at last he found his busy cousin again.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 85680]), Text sample: "You advised me to get more food," said Master Meadow Mouse.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44400]), Text sample: "But you didn't tell me where to get it."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58560]), Text sample: "In the orchard!" his cousin cried.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44640]), Text sample: And then he hurried away again.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 140160]), Text sample: "I wish he'd wait a minute," Master Meadow Mouse grumbled as he tore after his cousin once more.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 36480]), Text sample: "I don't feel like running.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 83280]), Text sample: The cousin seemed surprised when Master Meadow Mouse overtook him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 40320]), Text sample: "I've been chasing you.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89040]), Text sample: I want you to tell me what I'll find to eat when I go to the orchard."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53280]), Text sample: "That's easy," his cousin replied.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 154560]), Text sample: "Trees!" Having said those three words he dashed off again even faster than before.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65040]), Text sample: "Trees!" Master Meadow Mouse echoed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 40320]), Text sample: "I can't eat trees.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74160]), Text sample: There must be something that my cousin forgot to explain.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 102720]), Text sample: So I suppose I'll have to run after him again and ask him what he meant."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 107760]), Text sample: The fourth time that Master Meadow Mouse found his cousin he took no chances.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 84240]), Text sample: He caught his cousin by his tail and held on firmly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 117840]), Text sample: "You're not going to get away from me till I've found out what I want to know," he declared.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90000]), Text sample: "How can I eat a tree?" Master Meadow Mouse demanded.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 170880]), Text sample: "You can't!" his cousin replied, struggling desperately to free himself, for he was too busy to stop long.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 83520]), Text sample: "Then explain what you mean!" Master Meadow Mouse cried.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65760]), Text sample: "Eat the bark!" his cousin answered.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 96240]), Text sample: Then-and not till then-did Master Meadow Mouse let him go.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 265680]), Text sample: Master Meadow Mouse chased his cousin no more, but hurried away to Farmer Green's orchard, where he gnawed a ring all the way around one of the young fruit trees, at the top of the snow.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 80400]), Text sample: It was the first big meal he had enjoyed for weeks.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 120480]), Text sample: And he went home feeling that the winter was not so hard as he had thought, after all.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 50160]), Text sample: But Farmer Green didn't agree with him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 210480]), Text sample: When he happened to go into the orchard one day, later, and saw tree after tree ruined, he was very, very much displeased.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 119520]), Text sample: "I ought to have put wire netting around those young trees," he told the hired man.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52800]), Text sample: "This is what comes of a hard winter."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 18480]), Text sample: twenty one
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 27360]), Text sample: A Cold Dip
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74640]), Text sample: IN one way peter Mink was like Master Meadow Mouse.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 163920]), Text sample: He enjoyed swimming. And he spent a great deal of his time along the streams that threaded their way through Pleasant Valley.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78000]), Text sample: Sometimes peter dawdled on the banks of Swift River.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 84959]), Text sample: Sometimes he lingered for days in the neighborhood of Black Creek.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 101521]), Text sample: Nor did he disdain so small a stream as the brook that crossed the meadow.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43919]), Text sample: It was deep enough for a swim.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 73200]), Text sample: And he knew that muskrats lived under its banks.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 119760]), Text sample: If it hadn't been for the meadow mice perhaps he wouldn't have visited the brook so often.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 210961]), Text sample: So he ran one of his many snow tunnels to the brook, making a little opening that led under the ice, where the water had fallen away and left a cavern.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 206880]), Text sample: Just because there was skating for Johnnie Green on top of the brook it mustn't be supposed that Master Meadow Mouse wasn't going to have a swim when he wanted one.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 195839]), Text sample: When peter Mink wandered along a stream in winter he preferred to travel under the ice, rather than walk upon the upper side of it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 184801]), Text sample: It made little difference to him whether there was a dry strip along the edge of the stream, where he could steal silently along without wetting his feet.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 62640]), Text sample: When he found no place to walk, he swam.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 73920]), Text sample: To be sure, Master Meadow Mouse tried to be careful.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 149762]), Text sample: Before he crept from the end of his tunnel, he stuck his head out and looked up and down and all around.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51361]), Text sample: He peeped under the bank of the brook.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49440]), Text sample: He even stared into the water.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 191519]), Text sample: And then-if he saw nobody that was fiercer than Paddy Muskrat-only then would he venture to skip to the water's edge and plunge in.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 184079]), Text sample: To tell the truth, Master Meadow Mouse always felt safer when one of the Muskrat family happened to be taking a swim at the same time.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 119039]), Text sample: For the Muskrats all had a warning signal that told everybody when there was danger.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 198480]), Text sample: When one of them caught sight of peter Mink he never failed-if he was in the water-to give a loud slap upon the surface with his tail.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 288481]), Text sample: Master Meadow Mouse always had one ear that was listening for that slap. And when it sounded he never waited an instant, but darted into his tunnel without even stopping to shake the water off his coat.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 195120]), Text sample: He said that he could dry his coat after he reached home; while if he stopped to dry it at the edge of the brook perhaps he'd never get home at all.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 158880]), Text sample: You might think that now and then he would have said to himself, "Oh, I won't bother to look for peter Mink to day.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39360]), Text sample: He must be miles away.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 218639]), Text sample: I'll step right out of my tunnel and have my swim without taking a look see first." But Master Meadow Mouse was never so lazy as that.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 181199]), Text sample: And the day came at last when it was well worth his while to take the little extra trouble of peeping out before he had his swim.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 194399]), Text sample: For Master Meadow Mouse caught a glimpse of a snakelike head that darted out from under the bank of the brook and darted back again, out of sight.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 28320]), Text sample: THE SEEING HAND

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 93840]), Text sample: He was rolling on the grass, with pleasure in every muscle and limb.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 355920]), Text sample: I wanted to catch a picture of him in my fingers, and I touched him as lightly as I would cobwebs; but lo, his fat body revolved, stiffened and solidified into an upright position, and his tongue gave my hand a lick!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 91680]), Text sample: He loved it with his tail, with his paw, with his tongue.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 207600]), Text sample: If he could speak, I believe he would say with me that paradise is attained by touch; for in touch is all love and intelligence.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 164880]), Text sample: This small incident started me on a chat about hands, and if my chat is fortunate I have to thank my dog star.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 277680]), Text sample: In any case, it is pleasant to have something to talk about that no one else has monopolized; it is like making a new path in the trackless woods, blazing the trail where no foot has pressed before.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 75840]), Text sample: But at the very outset we encounter a difficulty.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 185280]), Text sample: You are so accustomed to light, I fear you will stumble when I try to guide you through the land of darkness and silence.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72240]), Text sample: The blind are not supposed to be the best of guides.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 205680]), Text sample: Still, though I cannot warrant not to lose you, I promise that you shall not be led into fire or water, or fall into a deep pit.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 261600]), Text sample: If you will follow me patiently, you will find that "there's a sound so fine, nothing lives 'twixt it and silence," and that there is more meant in things than meets the eye.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 196080]), Text sample: In large measure we travel the same highways, read the same books, speak the same language, yet our experiences are different.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 81120]), Text sample: All my comings and goings turn on the hand as on a pivot.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 81600]), Text sample: It is the hand that binds me to the world of men and women.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 204000]), Text sample: The hand is my feeler with which I reach through isolation and darkness and seize every pleasure, every activity that my fingers encounter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 231840]), Text sample: With the dropping of a little word from another's hand into mine, a slight flutter of the fingers, began the intelligence, the joy, the fullness of my life.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 158160]), Text sample: Like Job, I feel as if a hand had made me, fashioned me together round about and moulded my very soul.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90480]), Text sample: In all my experiences and thoughts I am conscious of a hand.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 295680]), Text sample: You might as well say that a sight which makes you glad, or a blow which brings the stinging tears to your eyes, is unreal as to say that those impressions are unreal which I have accumulated by means of touch.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 108480]), Text sample: Ideas make the world we live in, and impressions furnish ideas.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 125040]), Text sample: Remember that you, dependent on your sight, do not realize how many things are tangible.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 239520]), Text sample: All palpable things are mobile or rigid, solid or liquid, big or small, warm or cold, and these qualities are variously modified.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 313200]), Text sample: The coolness of a water lily rounding into bloom is different from the coolness of an evening wind in summer, and different again from the coolness of the rain that soaks into the hearts of growing things and gives them life and body.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 168720]), Text sample: The hardness of the rock is to the hardness of wood what a man's deep bass is to a woman's voice when it is low.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 241440]), Text sample: What I call beauty I find in certain combinations of all these qualities, and is largely derived from the flow of curved and straight lines which is over all things.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39360]), Text sample: It symbolizes duty.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 277920]), Text sample: When I have something to do that must not be set aside, I feel as if I were going forward in a straight line, bound to arrive somewhere, or go on forever without swerving to the right or to the left.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35040]), Text sample: That is what it means.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 111360]), Text sample: To escape this moralizing you should ask, "How does the straight line feel?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 141840]), Text sample: It feels, as I suppose it looks, straight-a dull thought drawn out endlessly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 183600]), Text sample: Eloquence to the touch resides not in straight lines, but in unstraight lines, or in many curved and straight lines together.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 160080]), Text sample: They appear and disappear, are now deep, now shallow, now broken off or lengthened or swelling.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 187440]), Text sample: They rise and sink beneath my fingers, they are full of sudden starts and pauses, and their variety is inexhaustible and wonderful.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 275280]), Text sample: So you see I am not shut out from the region of the beautiful, though my hand cannot perceive the brilliant colours in the sunset or on the mountain, or reach into the blue depths of the sky.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 314160]), Text sample: A tangible object passes complete into my brain with the warmth of life upon it, and occupies the same place that it does in space; for, without egotism, the mind is as large as the universe.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90000]), Text sample: When I think of hills, I think of the upward strength I tread upon.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 207840]), Text sample: When water is the object of my thought, I feel the cool shock of the plunge and the quick yielding of the waves that crisp and curl and ripple about my body.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 212640]), Text sample: The pleasing changes of rough and smooth, pliant and rigid, curved and straight in the bark and branches of a tree give the truth to my hand.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 198000]), Text sample: My fingers are tickled to delight by the soft ripple of a baby's laugh, and find amusement in the lusty crow of the barnyard autocrat.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 118560]), Text sample: Once I had a pet rooster that used to perch on my knee and stretch his neck and crow.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 102000]), Text sample: A bird in my hand was then worth two in the-barnyard.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 184320]), Text sample: My fingers cannot, of course, get the impression of a large whole at a glance; but I feel the parts, and my mind puts them together.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 182160]), Text sample: I move around my house, touching object after object in order, before I can form an idea of the entire house.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 277920]), Text sample: In other people's houses I can touch only what is shown to me-the chief objects of interest, carvings on the wall, or a curious architectural feature, exhibited like the family album.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 165118]), Text sample: Therefore a house with which I am not familiar has for me, at first, no general effect or harmony of detail.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 193440]), Text sample: It is not a complete conception, but a collection of object impressions which, as they come to me, are disconnected and isolated.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 160322]), Text sample: But my mind is full of associations, sensations, theories, and with them it constructs the house.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 117841]), Text sample: The silent worker is imagination which decrees reality out of chaos.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 86640]), Text sample: Without imagination what a poor thing my world would be!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 139199]), Text sample: My garden would be a silent patch of earth strewn with sticks of a variety of shapes and smells.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 250560]), Text sample: But when the eye of my mind is opened to its beauty, the bare ground brightens beneath my feet, and the hedge row bursts into leaf, and the rose tree shakes its fragrance everywhere.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 191281]), Text sample: I know how budding trees look, and I enter into the amorous joy of the mating birds, and this is the miracle of imagination.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 226560]), Text sample: Although, compared with the life warm, mobile face of a friend, the marble is cold and pulseless and unresponsive, yet it is beautiful to my hand.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 529199]), Text sample: Its flowing curves and bendings are a real pleasure; only breath is wanting; but under the spell of the imagination the marble thrills and becomes the divine reality of the ideal. Imagination puts a sentiment into every line and curve, and the statue in my touch is indeed the goddess herself who breathes and moves and enchants.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 156479]), Text sample: It is true, however, that some sculptures, even recognized masterpieces, do not please my hand.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 204000]), Text sample: When I touch what there is of the Winged Victory, it reminds me at first of a headless, limbless dream that flies towards me in an unrestful sleep.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 217199]), Text sample: The garments of the Victory thrust stiffly out behind, and do not resemble garments that I have felt flying, fluttering, folding, spreading in the wind.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 161762]), Text sample: I find in a beautiful statue perfection of bodily form, the qualities of balance and completeness.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 80159]), Text sample: So imagination crowns the experience of my hands.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32400]), Text sample: THE FIRST DAY
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 421920]), Text sample: Mile after mile of the rough trail fell behind him, and still the pony shambled along at a loose trot or a swinging canter; the steep upgrades it took at a steady jog and where the slopes pitched sharply down, it wound among the rocks with a faultless sureness of foot.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 93120]), Text sample: The day after the Cutters left, Antonia came over to see us.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74400]), Text sample: Grandmother noticed that she seemed troubled and distracted.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 180480]), Text sample: I could n't sleep much last night." She hesitated, and then told us how strangely mr Cutter had behaved before he went away.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 144240]), Text sample: She would be perfectly safe, he said, as he had just put a new Yale lock on the front door.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 131040]), Text sample: She had n't liked the way he kept coming into the kitchen to instruct her, or the way he looked at her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 138720]), Text sample: "I feel as if he is up to some of his tricks again, and is going to try to scare me, somehow."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44640]), Text sample: Antonia turned to me eagerly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 62160]), Text sample: I'd make up my bed nice and fresh for you.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68400]), Text sample: I was afraid to leave the window open last night."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 160560]), Text sample: I found that I slept there as well as anywhere, and when I got home in the morning, Tony had a good breakfast waiting for me.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 141600]), Text sample: The third night I spent at the Cutters', I awoke suddenly with the impression that I had heard a door open and shut.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82800]), Text sample: The next thing I knew, I felt some one sit down on the edge of the bed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 127200]), Text sample: I was only half awake, but I decided that he might take the Cutters' silver, whoever he was.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 59760]), Text sample: I held my breath and lay absolutely still.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 194640]), Text sample: A hand closed softly on my shoulder, and at the same moment I felt something hairy and cologne scented brushing my face.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 81120]), Text sample: I caught a handful of whiskers and pulled, shouting something.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66000]), Text sample: Where is she, you nasty whelp, where is she?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42960]), Text sample: Under the bed, are you, hussy?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65760]), Text sample: I know your tricks! Wait till I get at you!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 192720]), Text sample: So long as Cutter had me by the throat, there was no chance for me at all. I got hold of his thumb and bent it back, until he let go with a yell.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 97920]), Text sample: Her cry of fright awakened me. Truly, I was a battered object.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54000]), Text sample: My lip was cut and stood out like a snout.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 157200]), Text sample: My nose looked like a big blue plum, and one eye was swollen shut and hideously discolored.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 118800]), Text sample: She seemed to understand, though I was too faint and miserable to go into explanations.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 115920]), Text sample: She spent the whole morning bathing and poulticing me, and rubbing me with arnica.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68160]), Text sample: She had let me in for all this disgustingness.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 143760]), Text sample: The agent said his face was striped with court plaster, and he carried his left hand in a sling.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 120720]), Text sample: They found the place locked up, and they had to break the window to get into Antonia's bedroom.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 148320]), Text sample: There stood mrs Cutter,--locked out, for she had no key to the new lock-her head trembling with rage.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 119520]), Text sample: "I advised her to control herself, or she would have a stroke," grandmother said afterwards.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48000]), Text sample: Then mrs Cutter told her story.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 55680]), Text sample: He bought her ticket and put her on the train.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 97200]), Text sample: She saw him slip a twenty dollar bill into her handbag with her ticket.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64081]), Text sample: Certainly Cutter liked to have his wife think him a devil.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20640]), Text sample: CHAPTER two
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 270000]), Text sample: After two years of training he went to sea, and entering the regions so well known to his imagination, found them strangely barren of adventure. He made many voyages.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 378960]), Text sample: He knew the magic monotony of existence between sky and water: he had to bear the criticism of men, the exactions of the sea, and the prosaic severity of the daily task that gives bread-but whose only reward is in the perfect love of the work.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42960]), Text sample: This reward eluded him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 174480]), Text sample: Yet he could not go back, because there is nothing more enticing, disenchanting, and enslaving than the life at sea.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47040]), Text sample: Besides, his prospects were good.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 96960]), Text sample: That truth is not so often made apparent as people might think.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 146640]), Text sample: He did not care what the end would be, and in his lucid moments overvalued his indifference.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 125520]), Text sample: The danger, when not seen, has the imperfect vagueness of human thought.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 273600]), Text sample: The fear grows shadowy; and Imagination, the enemy of men, the father of all terrors, unstimulated, sinks to rest in the dullness of exhausted emotion.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 83520]), Text sample: Jim saw nothing but the disorder of his tossed cabin.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 175200]), Text sample: He lay there battened down in the midst of a small devastation, and felt secretly glad he had not to go on deck.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 528960]), Text sample: But now and again an uncontrollable rush of anguish would grip him bodily, make him gasp and writhe under the blankets, and then the unintelligent brutality of an existence liable to the agony of such sensations filled him with a despairing desire to escape at any cost. Then fine weather returned, and he thought no more about It.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 162720]), Text sample: His lameness, however, persisted, and when the ship arrived at an Eastern port he had to go to the hospital.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 79920]), Text sample: His recovery was slow, and he was left behind.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147360]), Text sample: There were perfumes in it, suggestions of infinite repose, the gift of endless dreams.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 153120]), Text sample: Directly he could walk without a stick, he descended into the town to look for some opportunity to get home.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 157920]), Text sample: Nothing offered just then, and, while waiting, he associated naturally with the men of his calling in the port.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 38400]), Text sample: These were of two kinds.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 240000]), Text sample: Some, very few and seen there but seldom, led mysterious lives, had preserved an undefaced energy with the temper of buccaneers and the eyes of dreamers.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 386160]), Text sample: They appeared to live in a crazy maze of plans, hopes, dangers, enterprises, ahead of civilisation, in the dark places of the sea; and their death was the only event of their fantastic existence that seemed to have a reasonable certitude of achievement.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 192960]), Text sample: The majority were men who, like himself, thrown there by some accident, had remained as officers of country ships.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 100080]), Text sample: They were attuned to the eternal peace of Eastern sky and sea.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 160560]), Text sample: They loved short passages, good deck chairs, large native crews, and the distinction of being white.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 378240]), Text sample: They shuddered at the thought of hard work, and led precariously easy lives, always on the verge of dismissal, always on the verge of engagement, serving Chinamen, Arabs, half castes-would have served the devil himself had he made it easy enough.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 174240]), Text sample: To Jim that gossiping crowd, viewed as seamen, seemed at first more unsubstantial than so many shadows.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 282720]), Text sample: In time, beside the original disdain there grew up slowly another sentiment; and suddenly, giving up the idea of going home, he took a berth as chief mate of the Patna.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 210240]), Text sample: The Patna was a local steamer as old as the hills, lean like a greyhound, and eaten up with rust worse than a condemned water tank.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 644639]), Text sample: Eight hundred men and women with faith and hopes, with affections and memories, they had collected there, coming from north and south and from the outskirts of the East, after treading the jungle paths, descending the rivers, coasting in praus along the shallows, crossing in small canoes from island to island, passing through suffering, meeting strange sights, beset by strange fears, upheld by one desire.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 146880]), Text sample: They came from solitary huts in the wilderness, from populous campongs, from villages by the sea.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 277918]), Text sample: At the call of an idea they had left their forests, their clearings, the protection of their rulers, their prosperity, their poverty, the surroundings of their youth and the graves of their fathers.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 124800]), Text sample: He walked slowly aboard, handsome and grave in his white gown and large turban.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 152639]), Text sample: A string of servants followed, loaded with his luggage; the Patna cast off and backed away from the wharf.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 291120]), Text sample: She was headed between two small islets, crossed obliquely the anchoring ground of sailing ships, swung through half a circle in the shadow of a hill, then ranged close to a ledge of foaming reefs.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 133440]), Text sample: She cleared the Strait, crossed the bay, continued on her way through the 'One degree' passage.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 343200]), Text sample: She held on straight for the Red Sea under a serene sky, under a sky scorching and unclouded, enveloped in a fulgor of sunshine that killed all thought, oppressed the heart, withered all impulses of strength and energy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 340560]), Text sample: And under the sinister splendour of that sky the sea, blue and profound, remained still, without a stir, without a ripple, without a wrinkle-viscous, stagnant, dead.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 434161]), Text sample: The Patna, with a slight hiss, passed over that plain, luminous and smooth, unrolled a black ribbon of smoke across the sky, left behind her on the water a white ribbon of foam that vanished at once, like the phantom of a track drawn upon a lifeless sea by the phantom of a steamer.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 120719]), Text sample: The five whites on board lived amidships, isolated from the human cargo.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 315121]), Text sample: The awnings covered the deck with a white roof from stem to stern, and a faint hum, a low murmur of sad voices, alone revealed the presence of a crowd of people upon the great blaze of the ocean.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 552241]), Text sample: Such were the days, still, hot, heavy, disappearing one by one into the past, as if falling into an abyss for ever open in the wake of the ship; and the ship, lonely under a wisp of smoke, held on her steadfast way black and smouldering in a luminous immensity, as if scorched by a flame flicked at her from a heaven without pity.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 80639]), Text sample: The nights descended on her like a benediction.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23040]), Text sample: CHAPTER four
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 583680]), Text sample: A month or so afterwards, when Jim, in answer to pointed questions, tried to tell honestly the truth of this experience, he said, speaking of the ship: 'She went over whatever it was as easy as a snake crawling over a stick.' The illustration was good: the questions were aiming at facts, and the official Inquiry was being held in the police court of an Eastern port.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 275040]), Text sample: Outside the court the sun blazed-within was the wind of great punkahs that made you shiver, the shame that made you burn, the attentive eyes whose glance stabbed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 223200]), Text sample: The face of the presiding magistrate, clean shaved and impassible, looked at him deadly pale between the red faces of the two nautical assessors.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 343200]), Text sample: The light of a broad window under the ceiling fell from above on the heads and shoulders of the three men, and they were fiercely distinct in the half light of the big court room where the audience seemed composed of staring shadows.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37920]), Text sample: They wanted facts.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 19440]), Text sample: Facts!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 120480]), Text sample: They demanded facts from him, as if facts could explain anything!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 270000]), Text sample: 'After you had concluded you had collided with something floating awash, say a water logged wreck, you were ordered by your captain to go forward and ascertain if there was any damage done.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 123360]), Text sample: Did you think it likely from the force of the blow?' asked the assessor sitting to the left.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 163200]), Text sample: 'I did not,' said Jim. 'I was told to call no one and to make no noise for fear of creating a panic.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44640]), Text sample: I thought the precaution reasonable.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 188400]), Text sample: I took one of the lamps that were hung under the awnings and went forward. After opening the forepeak hatch I heard splashing in there.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 127920]), Text sample: I knew then there must be a big hole below the water line.' He paused.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 229920]), Text sample: 'Yes,' said the big assessor, with a dreamy smile at the blotting pad; his fingers played incessantly, touching the paper without noise.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53760]), Text sample: 'I did not think of danger just then.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 139200]), Text sample: I might have been a little startled: all this happened in such a quiet way and so very suddenly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 151200]), Text sample: I knew there was no other bulkhead in the ship but the collision bulkhead separating the forepeak from the forehold.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39120]), Text sample: I went back to tell the captain.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 298080]), Text sample: I came upon the second engineer getting up at the foot of the bridge ladder: he seemed dazed, and told me he thought his left arm was broken; he had slipped on the top step when getting down while I was forward.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 38880]), Text sample: He exclaimed, "My God!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49200]), Text sample: His left arm hung by his side.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 248160]), Text sample: I followed up in time to see the captain rush at him and knock him down flat on his back. He did not strike him again: he stood bending over him and speaking angrily but quite low.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 148320]), Text sample: I fancy he was asking him why the devil he didn't go and stop the engines, instead of making a row about it on deck.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43200]), Text sample: I heard him say, "Get up!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 177840]), Text sample: The engineer slid down the starboard ladder and bolted round the skylight to the engine room companion which was on the port side.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 317280]), Text sample: He spoke slowly; he remembered swiftly and with extreme vividness; he could have reproduced like an echo the moaning of the engineer for the better information of these men who wanted facts.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46080]), Text sample: He was anxious to make this clear.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 191520]), Text sample: This had not been a common affair, everything in it had been of the utmost importance, and fortunately he remembered everything.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 336960]), Text sample: 'The captain kept on moving here and there on the bridge; he seemed calm enough, only he stumbled several times; and once as I stood speaking to him he walked right into me as though he had been stone blind.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 80400]), Text sample: He made no definite answer to what I had to tell.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 232080]), Text sample: He mumbled to himself; all I heard of it were a few words that sounded like "confounded steam!" and "infernal steam!"--something about steam.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 19680]), Text sample: I thought . . .'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 254160]), Text sample: He was becoming irrelevant; a question to the point cut short his speech, like a pang of pain, and he felt extremely discouraged and weary.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 170160]), Text sample: He was coming to that, he was coming to that-and now, checked brutally, he had to answer by yes or no
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 360720]), Text sample: He answered truthfully by a curt 'Yes, I did'; and fair of face, big of frame, with young, gloomy eyes, he held his shoulders upright above the box while his soul writhed within him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 148800]), Text sample: He was made to answer another question so much to the point and so useless, then waited again.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 170640]), Text sample: His mouth was tastelessly dry, as though he had been eating dust, then salt and bitter as after a drink of sea water.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 334320]), Text sample: Jim's eyes, wandering in the intervals of his answers, rested upon a white man who sat apart from the others, with his face worn and clouded, but with quiet eyes that glanced straight, interested and clear.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 289440]), Text sample: Jim answered another question and was tempted to cry out, 'What's the good of this! what's the good!' He tapped with his foot slightly, bit his lip, and looked away over the heads.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 223919]), Text sample: He met the eyes of the white man. The glance directed at him was not the fascinated stare of the others. It was an act of intelligent volition.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 133440]), Text sample: Jim between two questions forgot himself so far as to find leisure for a thought.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 143521]), Text sample: This fellow-ran the thought-looks at me as though he could see somebody or something past my shoulder.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 146159]), Text sample: He had come across that man before-in the street perhaps. He was positive he had never spoken to him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 306721]), Text sample: For days, for many days, he had spoken to no one, but had held silent, incoherent, and endless converse with himself, like a prisoner alone in his cell or like a wayfarer lost in a wilderness.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 226320]), Text sample: At present he was answering questions that did not matter though they had a purpose, but he doubted whether he would ever again speak out as long as he lived.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 167041]), Text sample: The sound of his own truthful statements confirmed his deliberate opinion that speech was of no use to him any longer.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82800]), Text sample: That man there seemed to be aware of his hopeless difficulty.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 140400]), Text sample: Jim looked at him, then turned away resolutely, as after a final parting.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 271440]), Text sample: And later on, many times, in distant parts of the world, Marlow showed himself willing to remember Jim, to remember him at length, in detail and audibly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 242400]), Text sample: Perhaps it would be after dinner, on a verandah draped in motionless foliage and crowned with flowers, in the deep dusk speckled by fiery cigar ends.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 104400]), Text sample: The elongated bulk of each cane chair harboured a silent listener.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24000]), Text sample: CHAPTER eleven
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 92640]), Text sample: "You are an awful good sort to listen like this," he said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 25920]), Text sample: "It does me good.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 80640]), Text sample: You don't" . . . words seemed to fail him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44400]), Text sample: It was a distinct glimpse.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 598320]), Text sample: He was a youngster of the sort you like to see about you; of the sort you like to imagine yourself to have been; of the sort whose appearance claims the fellowship of these illusions you had thought gone out, extinct, cold, and which, as if rekindled at the approach of another flame, give a flutter deep, deep down somewhere, give a flutter of light . . . of heat! . . .
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 127200]), Text sample: It is so difficult-so awfully unfair-so hard to understand."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44160]), Text sample: 'The mists were closing again.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 105600]), Text sample: I don't know how old I appeared to him-and how much wise.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 164400]), Text sample: Not half as old as I felt just then; not half as uselessly wise as I knew myself to be.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 418320]), Text sample: Surely in no other craft as in that of the sea do the hearts of those already launched to sink or swim go out so much to the youth on the brink, looking with shining eyes upon that glitter of the vast surface which is only a reflection of his own glances full of fire.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 341760]), Text sample: What wonder that when some heavy prod gets home the bond is found to be close; that besides the fellowship of the craft there is felt the strength of a wider feeling-the feeling that binds a man to a child.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 428160]), Text sample: He was there before me, believing that age and wisdom can find a remedy against the pain of truth, giving me a glimpse of himself as a young fellow in a scrape that is the very devil of a scrape, the sort of scrape greybeards wag at solemnly while they hide a smile.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 87600]), Text sample: And he had been deliberating upon death-confound him!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 195360]), Text sample: He had found that to meditate about because he thought he had saved his life, while all its glamour had gone with the ship in the night.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 80160]), Text sample: It was the sort of thing one does not expect to happen to one.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64560]), Text sample: It was not like a fight, for instance."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45120]), Text sample: '"It was not," I admitted.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 80880]), Text sample: He appeared changed, as if he had suddenly matured.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67920]), Text sample: '"One couldn't be sure," he muttered.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 204720]), Text sample: You were not sure," I said, and was placated by the sound of a faint sigh that passed between us like the flight of a bird in the night.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66480]), Text sample: '"Well, I wasn't," he said courageously.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78240]), Text sample: "It was something like that wretched story they made up.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89520]), Text sample: It was not a lie-but it wasn't truth all the same.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 26160]), Text sample: It was something. . . .
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 50640]), Text sample: One knows a downright lie.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 163680]), Text sample: '"How much more did you want?" I asked; but I think I spoke so low that he did not catch what I said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 141840]), Text sample: He had advanced his argument as though life had been a network of paths separated by chasms.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 281280]), Text sample: In thirty seconds, as it seemed certain then, I would have been overboard; and do you think I would not have laid hold of the first thing that came in my way-oar, life buoy, grating-anything?

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 255840]), Text sample: You said you would believe." "Of course I do," I protested, in a matter of fact tone which produced a calming effect. "Forgive me," he said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 30720]), Text sample: I ought to have known . . .
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 171120]), Text sample: I am-I am-a gentleman too . . ." "Yes, yes," I said hastily.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 106080]), Text sample: He was looking me squarely in the face, and withdrew his gaze slowly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 115200]), Text sample: "Now you understand why I didn't after all . . . didn't go out in that way.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 306240]), Text sample: I might have lasted it out better than many others. There's nothing the matter with my heart." He withdrew his right fist from his pocket, and the blow he struck on his chest resounded like a muffled detonation in the night.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 97440]), Text sample: He meditated, with his legs slightly apart and his chin sunk.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 62640]), Text sample: "A hair's breadth," he muttered.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63600]), Text sample: "Not the breadth of a hair between this and that.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24960]), Text sample: And at the time . . ."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 158160]), Text sample: '"It is difficult to see a hair at midnight," I put in, a little viciously I fear.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 77760]), Text sample: Don't you see what I mean by the solidarity of the craft?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 380160]), Text sample: I was aggrieved against him, as though he had cheated me-me!--of a splendid opportunity to keep up the illusion of my beginnings, as though he had robbed our common life of the last spark of its glamour. "And so you cleared out-at once."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 70560]), Text sample: '"Jumped," he corrected me incisively.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 165120]), Text sample: "Jumped-mind!" he repeated, and I wondered at the evident but obscure intention.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23040]), Text sample: "Well, yes!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44640]), Text sample: Perhaps I could not see then.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 31919]), Text sample: And I could think, too.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 120721]), Text sample: Nobody would know, of course, but this did not make it any easier for me.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 103681]), Text sample: You've got to believe that, too. I did not want all this talk. . . .
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 14880]), Text sample: Yes . . .

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64079]), Text sample: I am-I am not afraid to tell.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46798]), Text sample: And I wasn't afraid to think either.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 31919]), Text sample: I looked it in the face.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35520]), Text sample: I wasn't going to run away.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58800]), Text sample: I was not going to give them that satisfaction.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23041]), Text sample: They had done enough.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 87840]), Text sample: They made up a story, and believed it for all I know.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 128401]), Text sample: But I knew the truth, and I would live it down-alone, with myself.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78960]), Text sample: I wasn't going to give in to such a beastly unfair thing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39361]), Text sample: What did it prove after all?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 246241]), Text sample: I was confoundedly cut up. Sick of life-to tell you the truth; but what would have been the good to shirk it-in-in-that way?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 31681]), Text sample: That was not the way.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 160320]), Text sample: I believe-I believe it would have-it would have ended-nothing."

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 121681]), Text sample: Would have ended nothing," he muttered over me obstinately, after a little while.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 145680]), Text sample: ADAM understood Dinah's haste to go away, and drew hope rather than discouragement from it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78480]), Text sample: "I wish I'd asked her to write to me, though," he thought.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 101040]), Text sample: She wants to be quite quiet in her old way for a while.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 107520]), Text sample: And I've no right to be impatient and interrupting her with my wishes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 132720]), Text sample: She's told me what her mind is, and she's not a woman to say one thing and mean another.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35040]), Text sample: I'll wait patiently."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 285600]), Text sample: That was Adam's wise resolution, and it throve excellently for the first two or three weeks on the nourishment it got from the remembrance of Dinah's confession that Sunday afternoon.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 115440]), Text sample: There is a wonderful amount of sustenance in the first few words of love.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 205920]), Text sample: But towards the middle of October the resolution began to dwindle perceptibly, and showed dangerous symptoms of exhaustion.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 150480]), Text sample: The weeks were unusually long: Dinah must surely have had more than enough time to make up her mind.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 176400]), Text sample: He treads the earth with a very elastic step as he walks away from her, and makes light of all difficulties.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 189840]), Text sample: But that sort of glow dies out: memory gets sadly diluted with time, and is not strong enough to revive us.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 83520]), Text sample: Adam was no longer so confident as he had been.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 192720]), Text sample: He began to fear that perhaps Dinah's old life would have too strong a grasp upon her for any new feeling to triumph.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 247200]), Text sample: If she had not felt this, she would surely have written to him to give him some comfort; but it appeared that she held it right to discourage him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 153120]), Text sample: As Adam's confidence waned, his patience waned with it, and he thought he must write himself.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 112320]), Text sample: He must ask Dinah not to leave him in painful doubt longer than was needful.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 165600]), Text sample: He sat up late one night to write her a letter, but the next morning he burnt it, afraid of its effect.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 205440]), Text sample: It would be worse to have a discouraging answer by letter than from her own lips, for her presence reconciled him to her will.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 319920]), Text sample: You perceive how it was: Adam was hungering for the sight of Dinah, and when that sort of hunger reaches a certain stage, a lover is likely to still it though he may have to put his future in pawn.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82800]), Text sample: But what harm could he do by going to Snowfield?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 62400]), Text sample: Dinah could not be displeased with him for it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48000]), Text sample: She had not forbidden him to go.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 75600]), Text sample: She must surely expect that he would go before long.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 394800]), Text sample: By the second Sunday in October this view of the case had become so clear to Adam that he was already on his way to Snowfield, on horseback this time, for his hours were precious now, and he had borrowed Jonathan Burge's good nag for the journey.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 234000]), Text sample: Adam could never cease to mourn over that mystery of human sorrow which had been brought so close to him; he could never thank God for another's misery.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 489600]), Text sample: And if I were capable of that narrow sighted joy in Adam's behalf, I should still know he was not the man to feel it for himself. He would have shaken his head at such a sentiment and said, "Evil's evil, and sorrow's sorrow, and you can't alter it's natur by wrapping it up in other words.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 181680]), Text sample: Other folks were not created for my sake, that I should think all square when things turn out well for me."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 318000]), Text sample: We can no more wish to return to a narrower sympathy than a painter or a musician can wish to return to his cruder manner, or a philosopher to his less complete formula.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 300240]), Text sample: His feeling towards Dinah, the hope of passing his life with her, had been the distant unseen point towards which that hard journey from Snowfield eighteen months ago had been leading him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 432000]), Text sample: Tender and deep as his love for Hetty had been-so deep that the roots of it would never be torn away-his love for Dinah was better and more precious to him, for it was the outgrowth of that fuller life which had come to him from his acquaintance with deep sorrow.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 169200]), Text sample: "It's like as if it was a new strength to me," he said to himself, "to love her and know as she loves me.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 606480]), Text sample: The scene looked less harsh in the soft October sunshine than it had in the eager time of early spring, and the one grand charm it possessed in common with all wide stretching woodless regions-that it filled you with a new consciousness of the overarching sky-had a milder, more soothing influence than usual, on this almost cloudless day.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 100560]), Text sample: "Perhaps that's the last hymn before they come away," Adam thought.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 491040]), Text sample: "I'll walk back a bit and turn again to meet her, farther off the village." He walked back till he got nearly to the top of the hill again, and seated himself on a loose stone, against the low wall, to watch till he should see the little black figure leaving the hamlet and winding up the hill.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 388319]), Text sample: He chose this spot, almost at the top of the hill, because it was away from all eyes-no house, no cattle, not even a nibbling sheep near-no presence but the still lights and shadows and the great embracing sky.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 69601]), Text sample: She was much longer coming than he expected.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 206642]), Text sample: He waited an hour at least watching for her and thinking of her, while the afternoon shadows lengthened and the light grew softer.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 187199]), Text sample: At last he saw the little black figure coming from between the grey houses and gradually approaching the foot of the hill.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 172320]), Text sample: Slowly, Adam thought, but Dinah was really walking at her usual pace, with a light quiet step.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 305279]), Text sample: Now she was beginning to wind along the path up the hill, but Adam would not move yet; he would not meet her too soon; he had set his heart on meeting her in this assured loneliness.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 104399]), Text sample: And now he began to fear lest he should startle her too much.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 210960]), Text sample: "Yet," he thought, "she's not one to be overstartled; she's always so calm and quiet, as if she was prepared for anything."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 77041]), Text sample: What was she thinking of as she wound up the hill?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 128400]), Text sample: On the verge of a decision we all tremble: hope pauses with fluttering wings.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 223200]), Text sample: Adam was glad, for, with the fine instinct of a lover, he felt that it would be best for her to hear his voice before she saw him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 248401]), Text sample: He came within three paces of her and then said, "Dinah!" She started without looking round, as if she connected the sound with no place.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72479]), Text sample: He knew quite well what was in her mind.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 261601]), Text sample: She was so accustomed to think of impressions as purely spiritual monitions that she looked for no material visible accompaniment of the voice.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 167279]), Text sample: What a look of yearning love it was that the mild grey eyes turned on the strong dark eyed man!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 115200]), Text sample: And they walked on so in silence, while the warm tears fell.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 50880]), Text sample: It was Dinah who spoke first.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 132959]), Text sample: My soul is so knit to yours that it is but a divided life I live without you.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 151202]), Text sample: And this moment, now you are with me, and I feel that our hearts are filled with the same love.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48720]), Text sample: If necessary, add seasoning.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 127200]), Text sample: THE CRAYFISH.--This is one of those fishes that were highly esteemed by the ancients.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 229680]), Text sample: The Greeks preferred it when brought from Alexandria, and the romans ate it boiled with cumin, and seasoned with pepper and other condiments.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 213120]), Text sample: More water would kill them, because the large quantity of air they require necessitates the water in which they are kept, to be continually renewed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89040]), Text sample: Simmer till the eels are tender, but do not break the fish.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 200400]), Text sample: Take them out carefully, mix the flour smoothly to a batter with the cream, bring it to a boil, pour over the eels, and serve.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 189600]), Text sample: Take a pint of the stock, put in the beards and the liquor, which must be carefully strained, and simmer for one half an hour.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 150480]), Text sample: Take it off the fire, strain it again, and add the remainder of the stock with the seasoning and mace.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 316800]), Text sample: Mary's unreasonableness, her stupid obstinacy, when she knew she was wrong and I was right, her willingness to break our friendship at the first opportunity, gave me little room to think of anything else.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 171840]), Text sample: That she should risk her reputation to run after that man was inexplicable, but it was just like a woman.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 381840]), Text sample: Well, if she could get along without me, I could get along without her.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60240]), Text sample: "What did you expect to find here?" I asked.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47280]), Text sample: "I didn't know what we might find.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 295440]), Text sample: If the man who fired those shots used this tree, I thought we might find an empty cartridge or two. There ought to be at least some broken twigs or something to show that he was up there, but I find nothing at all."

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 145920]), Text sample: It's going to hit us,' she called out, and I would be willing to swear it had something to do with the murder."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63120]), Text sample: The coroner thought a moment, then turned to me.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32400]), Text sample: "What else did she say?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 61440]), Text sample: "Nothing that seemed to refer to the accident.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147600]), Text sample: He could have come down within fifty feet of the ground and followed that car, pumping bullets into it all the way.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 130320]), Text sample: For a moment I saw red as I pictured Jim, helpless before approaching death.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35040]), Text sample: "That's up to us now.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 328320]), Text sample: An aeroplane has such speed that it was easy for Woods to fashion an ingenious alibi to account for every minute of his time on the night of the murder, but there must be some holes in it; there always is in a manufactured alibi.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 211678]), Text sample: For whenever Jesus came to Jerusalem, great crowds gathered around him. None of the priests dared to lay a finger on him in the open.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42238]), Text sample: The crowds would never let them.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89041]), Text sample: It seemed to the people as if the Messiah might have come at last.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 400560]), Text sample: Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, mrs Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 253920]), Text sample: She would not listen, therefore, to her daughter's proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 223200]), Text sample: After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 121440]), Text sample: Bingley met them with hopes that mrs Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 61680]), Text sample: "Indeed I have, sir," was her answer.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58080]), Text sample: "She is a great deal too ill to be moved.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74400]), Text sample: mr Jones says we must not think of moving her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47760]), Text sample: "Removed!" cried Bingley.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 36000]), Text sample: "It must not be thought of.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 222960]), Text sample: "You may depend upon it, Madam," said Miss Bingley, with cold civility, "that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she remains with us."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66480]), Text sample: mrs Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 433920]), Text sample: "I am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I have ever met with.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78240]), Text sample: I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 186480]), Text sample: "Whatever I do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 87360]), Text sample: "That is exactly what I should have supposed of you," said Elizabeth.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89760]), Text sample: "You begin to comprehend me, do you?" cried he, turning towards her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63360]), Text sample: "Oh! yes-I understand you perfectly."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 143760]), Text sample: "I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 143760]), Text sample: It does not follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 121680]), Text sample: "I did not know before," continued Bingley immediately, "that you were a studier of character.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43920]), Text sample: It must be an amusing study."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41520]), Text sample: They have at least that advantage."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 126480]), Text sample: "But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 128640]), Text sample: "Yes, indeed," cried mrs Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 157200]), Text sample: Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 134160]), Text sample: mrs Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78480]), Text sample: The country is a vast deal pleasanter, is it not, mr Bingley?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 167760]), Text sample: "When I am in the country," he replied, "I never wish to leave it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 108480]), Text sample: But that gentleman," looking at Darcy, "seemed to think the country was nothing at all."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49920]), Text sample: "You quite mistook mr Darcy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 187920]), Text sample: He only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town, which you must acknowledge to be true."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68880]), Text sample: I know we dine with four and twenty families."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 105600]), Text sample: Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 148560]), Text sample: His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towards mr Darcy with a very expressive smile.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 55680]), Text sample: "Yes, she called yesterday with her father.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42480]), Text sample: "Did Charlotte dine with you?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 69840]), Text sample: I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 92400]), Text sample: "Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 103920]), Text sample: Lady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 183120]), Text sample: I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane-one does not often see anybody better looking.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43200]), Text sample: It is what everybody says.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57120]), Text sample: I do not trust my own partiality.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 247440]), Text sample: When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother Gardiner's in town so much in love with her that my sister in law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49440]), Text sample: But, however, he did not.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 92880]), Text sample: "And so ended his affection," said Elizabeth impatiently.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 109680]), Text sample: I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 300480]), Text sample: She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence mrs Bennet began repeating her thanks to mr Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 190560]), Text sample: She performed her part indeed without much graciousness, but mrs Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 286319]), Text sample: She was very equal, therefore, to address mr Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 84000]), Text sample: I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24960]), Text sample: CHAPTER five
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 686160]), Text sample: Through Solway sands, through Taross moss, Blindfold, he knew the paths to cross: By wily turns, by desperate bounds, Had baffled Percy's best bloodhounds. In Eske, or Liddel, fords were none, But he would ride them, one by one; Alike to him was time or tide, December's snow or July's pride; Alike to him was tide or time, Moonless midnight or matin prime. --WALTER SCOTT.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 190080]), Text sample: All the members of the Wharton family laid their heads on their pillows that night, with a foreboding of some interruption to their ordinary quiet.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 361200]), Text sample: It was glittering with the opening brilliancy of one of those lovely, mild days, which occur about the time of the falling of the leaf; and which, by their frequency, class the American autumn with the most delightful seasons of other countries.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 254400]), Text sample: We have no spring; vegetation seems to leap into existence, instead of creeping, as in the same latitudes of the Old World; but how gracefully it retires!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 379200]), Text sample: September, October, even November and December, compose the season for enjoyment in the open air; they have their storms, but they are distinct, and not of long continuance, leaving a clear atmosphere and a cloudless sky.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 276240]), Text sample: As nothing could be seen likely to interrupt the enjoyments and harmony of such a day, the sisters descended to the parlor, with a returning confidence in their brother's security, and their own happiness.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 289680]), Text sample: "Why," said the captain, laughing, "I do acknowledge a little inquietude myself-but how was it with you?" turning to his younger and evidently favorite sister, and tapping her cheek.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 136080]), Text sample: "Did you see banners in the clouds, and mistake Miss Peyton's Aeolian harp for rebellious music?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 156720]), Text sample: "Run-Massa Harry-run-if he love old Caesar, run-here come a rebel horse."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 115440]), Text sample: "Run!" repeated the British officer, gathering himself up in military pride.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 294960]), Text sample: "No, mr Caesar, running is not my trade." While speaking, he walked deliberately to the window, where the family were already collected in the greatest consternation.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 175680]), Text sample: In advance, with an officer, was a man attired in the dress of a countryman, who pointed in the direction of the cottage.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 119760]), Text sample: On reaching the road which led through the bottom of the valley, they turned their horses' heads to the north.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 345600]), Text sample: Two or three of the dragoons now dismounted and disappeared; in a few minutes, however, they returned to the yard, followed by Katy, from whose violent gesticulations, it was evident that matters of no trifling concern were on the carpet.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 293520]), Text sample: A short communication with the loquacious housekeeper followed the arrival of the main body of the troop, and the advance party remounting, the whole moved towards the Locusts with great speed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 446640]), Text sample: As yet none of the family had sufficient presence of mind to devise any means of security for Captain Wharton; but the danger now became too pressing to admit of longer delay, and various means of secreting him were hastily proposed; but they were all haughtily rejected by the young man, as unworthy of his character.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 226800]), Text sample: It was too late to retreat to the woods in the rear of the cottage, for he would unavoidably be seen, and, followed by a troop of horse, as inevitably taken.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 256800]), Text sample: At length his sisters, with trembling hands, replaced his original disguise, the instruments of which had been carefully kept at hand by Caesar, in expectation of some sudden emergency.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 153840]), Text sample: Nothing remained now, but to meet the impending examination with as much indifference as the family could assume.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 268560]), Text sample: The leader of the horse dismounted, and, followed by a couple of his men, he approached the outer door of the building, which was slowly and reluctantly opened for his admission by Caesar.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 337200]), Text sample: The heavy tread of the trooper, as he followed the black to the door of the parlor, rang in the ears of the females as it approached nearer and nearer, and drove the blood from their faces to their hearts, with a chill that nearly annihilated feeling.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 314160]), Text sample: A man, whose colossal stature manifested the possession of vast strength, entered the room, and removing his cap, he saluted the family with a mildness his appearance did not indicate as belonging to his nature.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 254160]), Text sample: His dark hair hung around his brow in profusion, though stained with powder which was worn at that day, and his face was nearly hid in the whiskers by which it was disfigured.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 212880]), Text sample: Still, the expression of his eye, though piercing, was not bad, and his voice, though deep and powerful, was far from unpleasant.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 270720]), Text sample: Frances ventured to throw a timid glance at his figure as he entered, and saw at once the man from whose scrutiny Harvey Birch had warned them there was so much to be apprehended.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 167279]), Text sample: "You have no cause for alarm, ladies," said the officer, pausing a moment, and contemplating the pale faces around him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 177599]), Text sample: "My business will be confined to a few questions, which, if freely answered, will instantly remove us from your dwelling."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 132238]), Text sample: "This gentleman-here-favored us with his company during the rain, and has not yet departed."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 243600]), Text sample: "This gentleman!" repeated the other, turning to Captain Wharton, and contemplating his figure for a moment until the anxiety of his countenance gave place to a lurking smile.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 210720]), Text sample: He approached the youth with an air of comic gravity, and with a low bow, continued, "I am sorry for the severe cold you have in your head, sir."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 142079]), Text sample: "I!" exclaimed the captain, in surprise; "I have no cold in my head."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 145681]), Text sample: "I fancied it then, from seeing you had covered such handsome black locks with that ugly old wig.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 71040]), Text sample: It was my mistake; you will please to pardon it."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 223921]), Text sample: The captain himself moved his hand involuntarily to his head, and discovered that the trepidation of his sisters had left some of his natural hair exposed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 170159]), Text sample: The dragoon watched the movement with a continued smile, when, seeming to recollect himself, turning to the father, he proceeded,--
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 357840]), Text sample: "mr Harper," echoed the other, feeling a load removed from his heart, "yes, I had forgotten; but he is gone; and if there be anything wrong in his character, we are in entire ignorance of it; to me he was a total stranger."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 124800]), Text sample: "You have but little to apprehend from his character," answered the dragoon dryly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 114240]), Text sample: "But he is gone-how-when-and whither?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 174721]), Text sample: In a few moments orders were given to some of the troops, and horsemen left the valley, at full speed, by its various roads.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 155279]), Text sample: He bowed again politely as he reentered the room, and walking up to Captain Wharton, said, with comic gravity,--
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 114960]), Text sample: "I cannot, without violating the truth, say it is," returned the dragoon.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 127919]), Text sample: "I prefer your ebony hair, from which you seem to have combed the powder with great industry.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 222959]), Text sample: "You appear so close an observer of things, I should like your opinion of it, sir," said Henry, removing the silk, and exhibiting the cheek free from blemish.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 189601]), Text sample: "Upon my word, you improve most rapidly in externals," added the trooper, preserving his muscles in inflexible gravity.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 156961]), Text sample: Young Wharton very composedly did as was required and stood an extremely handsome, well dressed young man.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 129599]), Text sample: The dragoon looked at him for a minute with the drollery that characterized his manner, and then continued,--
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 108000]), Text sample: The countenance of Lawton changed instantly, and his assumed quaintness vanished.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 202801]), Text sample: He viewed the figure of Captain Wharton, as he stood proudly swelling with a pride that disdained further concealment, and exclaimed with great earnestness,--
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 73919]), Text sample: "Captain Wharton, from my soul I pity you!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 167280]), Text sample: He is not a spy; nothing but a desire to see his friends prompted him to venture so far from the regular army in disguise.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 122399]), Text sample: Leave him with us; there is no reward, no sum, which I will not cheerfully pay."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 421921]), Text sample: "Sir, your anxiety for your friend excuses your language," said Lawton, haughtily; "but you forget I am a Virginian, and a gentleman." Turning to the young man, he continued, "Were you ignorant, Captain Wharton, that our pickets have been below you for several days?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 128159]), Text sample: "I did not know it until I reached them, and it was then too late to retreat," said Wharton sullenly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 191039]), Text sample: "I came out, as my father has mentioned, to see my friends, understanding your parties to be at Peekskill, and near the Highlands, or surely I would not have ventured."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 152639]), Text sample: When treason reaches the grade of general officers, Captain Wharton, it behooves the friends of liberty to be vigilant."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 153600]), Text sample: Henry bowed to this remark in distant silence, but Sarah ventured to urge something in behalf of her brother.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 174000]), Text sample: "Dunwoodie!" exclaimed Frances, with a face in which the roses contended for the mastery with the paleness of apprehension.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 192240]), Text sample: Lawton regarded her with a mingled expression of pity and admiration; then shaking his head doubtingly, he continued,--
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 529920]), Text sample: Her dread on behalf of her brother was certainly greatly diminished; yet her form shook, her breathing became short and irregular, and her whole frame gave tokens of extraordinary agitation. Her eyes rose from the floor to the dragoon, and were again fixed immovably on the carpet-she evidently wished to utter something but was unequal to the effort.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 173279]), Text sample: Miss Peyton was a close observer of these movements of her niece, and advancing with an air of feminine dignity, inquired,--
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 293280]), Text sample: "Expresses are already on the road to announce to him our situation, and the intelligence will speedily bring him to this valley; unless, indeed, some private reasons may exist to make a visit particularly unpleasant."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64802]), Text sample: "We shall always be happy to see Major Dunwoodie."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 257279]), Text sample: "Oh! doubtless; he is a general favorite, May I presume on it so far as to ask leave to dismount and refresh my men, who compose a part of his squadron?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 234961]), Text sample: The officers were invited to take their morning's repast at the family breakfast table, and having made their arrangements without, the invitation was frankly accepted.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 484562]), Text sample: None of the watchfulness, which was so necessary to their situation, was neglected by the wary partisan. Patrols were seen on the distant hills, taking their protecting circuit around their comrades, who were enjoying, in the midst of danger, a security that can only spring from the watchfulness of discipline and the indifference of habit.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 221280]), Text sample: The ladies left the table to their guests, who proceeded, without much superfluous diffidence, to do proper honors to the hospitality of mr Wharton.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 284640]), Text sample: At length Captain Lawton suspended for a moment his violent attacks on the buckwheat cakes, to inquire of the master of the house, if there was not a peddler of the name of Birch who lived in the valley at times.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 313441]), Text sample: "That is strange, too," said the trooper, looking at the disconcerted host intently, "considering he is your next neighbor; he must be quite domestic, sir; and to the ladies it must be somewhat inconvenient.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 126961]), Text sample: I doubt not that that muslin in the window seat cost twice as much as he would have asked them for it."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 218399]), Text sample: The two subalterns struggled to conceal their smiles; but the captain resumed his breakfast with an eagerness that created a doubt, whether he ever expected to enjoy another.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 176160]), Text sample: The necessity of a supply from the dominion of Dinah soon, however, afforded another respite, of which Lawton availed himself.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 157682]), Text sample: "I had a wish to break this mr Birch of his unsocial habits, and gave him a call this morning," he said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 181682]), Text sample: "Had I found him within, I should have placed him where he would enjoy life in the midst of society, for a short time at least."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 146162]), Text sample: "And where might that be, sir?" asked mr Wharton, conceiving it necessary to say something.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 148318]), Text sample: "What is the offense of poor Birch?" asked Miss Peyton, handing the dragoon a fourth dish of coffee.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78000]), Text sample: "If he is poor, King George is a bad paymaster."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 167279]), Text sample: "And congress a halter," continued the commanding officer commencing anew on a fresh supply of the cakes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 168478]), Text sample: "If I catch him," cried the dragoon, while buttering another cake, "he will dangle from the limbs of one of his namesakes."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 142321]), Text sample: "He would make no bad ornament, suspended from one of those locusts before his own door," added the lieutenant.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 120961]), Text sample: "Never mind," continued the captain; "I will have him yet before I'm a major."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 311760]), Text sample: In fact, no small part of the bitterness expressed by Captain Lawton against the peddler, arose from the unaccountable disappearance of the latter, when intrusted to the custody of two of his most faithful dragoons.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90241]), Text sample: "By George, that's so, I must go and call on her before I go away."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63121]), Text sample: "Oh, never mind her," Hurstwood remarked.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46801]), Text sample: "Twelve o'clock," said Hurstwood.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57840]), Text sample: "That's right," said Drouet, going out.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53760]), Text sample: Little john and the Tanner of Blyth
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 384000]), Text sample: ONE FINE DAY, not long after Little john had left abiding with the Sheriff and had come back, with his worship's cook, to the merry greenwood, as has just been told, Robin Hood and a few chosen fellows of his band lay upon the soft sward beneath the greenwood tree where they dwelled.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 389520]), Text sample: The day was warm and sultry, so that while most of the band were scattered through the forest upon this mission and upon that, these few stout fellows lay lazily beneath the shade of the tree, in the soft afternoon, passing jests among themselves and telling merry stories, with laughter and mirth.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56160]), Text sample: Suddenly Robin Hood smote his knee.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 61680]), Text sample: It must be looked to, and that in quick season.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 36960]), Text sample: Come, busk thee, Little john!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 71280]), Text sample: "Nay," quoth Robin Hood, laughing louder than all.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 151920]), Text sample: "Heaven forbid that I should doubt thee, for I care for no taste of thy staff myself, Little john.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 239760]), Text sample: I must needs own that there are those of my band can handle a seven foot staff more deftly than I; yet no man in all Nottinghamshire can draw gray goose shaft with my fingers.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72720]), Text sample: Bide thou here till I bring thee money to pay our good Hugh.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 159600]), Text sample: I warrant he hath no better customers in all Nottinghamshire than we." So saying, Robin left them and entered the forest.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 279360]), Text sample: Not far from the trysting tree was a great rock in which a chamber had been hewn, the entrance being barred by a massive oaken door two palms'-breadth in thickness, studded about with spikes, and fastened with a great padlock.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 150480]), Text sample: First he looked up and then he looked down, and then, tilting his cap over one eye, he slowly scratched the back part of his head.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 125520]), Text sample: Four merry wags were at the Blue Boar Inn; a butcher, a beggar, and two barefoot friars.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 79440]), Text sample: Right glad were they to welcome such a merry blade as Little john.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 138000]), Text sample: Fresh cans of ale were brought, and with jest and song and merry tales the hours slipped away on fleeting wings.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 249360]), Text sample: None thought of time or tide till the night was so far gone that Little john put by the thought of setting forth upon his journey again that night, and so bided at the Blue Boar Inn until the morrow.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 242640]), Text sample: Now it was an ill piece of luck for Little john that he left his duty for his pleasure, and he paid a great score for it, as we are all apt to do in the same case, as you shall see.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 192720]), Text sample: In the good town of Blyth there lived a stout tanner, celebrated far and near for feats of strength and many tough bouts at wrestling and the quarterstaff.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 173040]), Text sample: Now Arthur had been to Nottingham Town the day before Little john set forth on his errand, there to sell a halfscore of tanned cowhides.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 124080]), Text sample: At the dawn of the same day that Little john left the inn, he started from Nottingham, homeward for Blyth.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 173280]), Text sample: His way led, all in the dewy morn, past the verge of Sherwood Forest, where the birds were welcoming the lovely day with a great and merry jubilee.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 302400]), Text sample: "Now," quoth Arthur a Bland to himself, when he had come to that part of the road that cut through a corner of the forest, "no doubt at this time of year the dun deer are coming from the forest depths nigher to the open meadow lands.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 274800]), Text sample: Accordingly, quitting the path, he went peeping this way and that through the underbrush, spying now here and now there, with all the wiles of a master of woodcraft, and of one who had more than once donned a doublet of Lincoln green.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 270959]), Text sample: "Nay," quoth he again, after a time, "this matter must e'en be looked into." So, quitting the highroad, he also entered the thickets, and began spying around after stout Arthur a Bland.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 131280]), Text sample: So for a long time they both of them went hunting about, Little john after the Tanner, and the Tanner after the deer.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 189359]), Text sample: At last Little john trod upon a stick, which snapped under his foot, whereupon, hearing the noise, the Tanner turned quickly and caught sight of the yeoman.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 98399]), Text sample: Seeing that the Tanner had spied him out, Little john put a bold face upon the matter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66480]), Text sample: Who art thou that comest ranging Sherwood's paths?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 202319]), Text sample: "Nay," quoth the Tanner boldly-for, though taken by surprise, he was not a man to be frightened by big words-"thou liest in thy teeth.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63601]), Text sample: I am no thief, but an honest craftsman.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 149519]), Text sample: As for my countenance, it is what it is; and, for the matter of that, thine own is none too pretty, thou saucy fellow."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 138000]), Text sample: "Marry come up with a murrain!" cried the Tanner, for he, too, had talked himself into a fume.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 165120]), Text sample: "Big words ne'er killed so much as a mouse. Who art thou that talkest so freely of cracking the head of Arthur a Bland?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35039]), Text sample: Now look to thyself, fellow!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42000]), Text sample: "Stay!" said Little john.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49440]), Text sample: "Let us first measure our cudgels.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68880]), Text sample: "Nay, I pass not for length," answered the Tanner.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 107280]), Text sample: "My staff is long enough to knock down a calf; so look to thyself, fellow, I say again."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 151919]), Text sample: So, without more ado, each gripped his staff in the middle, and, with fell and angry looks, they came slowly together.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 230640]), Text sample: So, being vexed to his heart by this, he set forth at dawn of day to seek Little john at the Blue Boar, or at least to meet the yeoman on the way, and ease his heart of what he thought of the matter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147360]), Text sample: "Surely," quoth he to himself, "that is Little John's voice, and he is talking in anger also.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60961]), Text sample: Methinks the other is strange to my ears.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48238]), Text sample: I must see to this matter, and that quickly."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 226079]), Text sample: Thus spoke Robin Hood to himself, all his anger passing away like a breath from the windowpane, at the thought that perhaps his trusty right-hand man was in some danger of his life.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 296880]), Text sample: I fear me, though, there is but poor chance of my seeing such a pleasant sight." So saying, he stretched himself at length upon the ground, that he might not only see the sport the better, but that he might enjoy the merry sight at his ease.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 252961]), Text sample: At last Little john struck like a flash, and-"rap!"--the Tanner met the blow and turned it aside, and then smote back at Little john, who also turned the blow; and so this mighty battle began.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 204000]), Text sample: But Little john suffered the most, for he had become unused to such stiff labor, and his joints were not as supple as they had been before he went to dwell with the Sheriff.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 128400]), Text sample: All this time Robin Hood lay beneath the bush, rejoicing at such a comely bout of quarterstaff.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 108000]), Text sample: Then, raising his staff, stout Arthur dealt him another blow upon the ribs.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43678]), Text sample: "Hold!" roared Little john.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39120]), Text sample: "Stop!" roared Little john.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 14880]), Text sample: "Help!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 170640]), Text sample: "And so thought I, also," cried Robin Hood, bursting out of the thicket and shouting with laughter till the tears ran down his cheeks.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 106799]), Text sample: "What may be thy name, good fellow?" said Robin, next, turning to the Tanner.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 91439]), Text sample: Thou didst break the crown of a friend of mine at the fair at Ely last October.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 100081]), Text sample: The folk there call him Jock o' Nottingham; we call him Will Scathelock.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 55681]), Text sample: His name is Little john, and mine Robin Hood."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 115201]), Text sample: Let me help thee to thy feet, good Master Little john, and let me brush the dust from off thy coat."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 127922]), Text sample: At this Robin laughed again, and, turning to the Tanner, he said, "Wilt thou join my band, good Arthur?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 96000]), Text sample: For I make my vow thou art one of the stoutest men that ever mine eyes beheld."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 81120]), Text sample: "Will I join thy band?" cried the Tanner joyfully.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 187201]), Text sample: "Ay, marry, will I! Hey for a merry life!" cried he, leaping aloft and snapping his fingers, "and hey for the life I love!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 180241]), Text sample: I will follow thee to the ends of the earth, good master, and not a herd of dun deer in all the forest but shall know the sound of the twang of my bowstring."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 28560]), Text sample: CHAPTER twenty eight.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 116640]), Text sample: If the solitude these mountains promise deceives me not, it is so; ah!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 368640]), Text sample: And so, senora, or senor, or whatever you prefer to be, dismiss the fears that our appearance has caused you and make us acquainted with your good or evil fortunes, for from all of us together, or from each one of us, you will receive sympathy in your trouble."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 202560]), Text sample: But to shorten the long recital of my woes, I will pass over in silence all the artifices employed by Don Fernando for declaring his passion for me.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 222961]), Text sample: This offer, and their sound advice strengthened my resolution, and I never gave Don Fernando a word in reply that could hold out to him any hope of success, however remote.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 393599]), Text sample: "All this caution of mine, which he must have taken for coyness, had apparently the effect of increasing his wanton appetite-for that is the name I give to his passion for me; had it been what he declared it to be, you would not know of it now, because there would have been no occasion to tell you of it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 142321]), Text sample: But proceed; by and by I may tell you something that will astonish you as much as it will excite your compassion."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 107760]), Text sample: Dorothea, however, did not interrupt her story, but went on in these words:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 263520]), Text sample: The youngest of the three brothers, whose name was Ferko, was a beautiful youth, with a splendid figure, blue eyes, fair hair, and a complexion like milk and roses.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 224400]), Text sample: His two brothers were as jealous of him as they could be, for they thought that with his good looks he would be sure to be more fortunate than they would ever be.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 274560]), Text sample: Ferko fell fast asleep, but the other two remained awake, and the eldest said to the second brother, 'What do you say to doing our brother Ferko some harm?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90000]), Text sample: If we could only get him out of the way we might succeed better.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 337200]), Text sample: 'I quite agree with you,' answered the second brother, 'and my advice is to eat up his loaf of bread, and then to refuse to give him a bit of ours until he has promised to let us put out his eyes or break his legs.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 240240]), Text sample: His eldest brother was delighted with this proposal, and the two wicked wretches seized Ferko's loaf and ate it all up, while the poor boy was still asleep.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 341040]), Text sample: When he did awake he felt very hungry and turned to eat his bread, but his brothers cried out, 'You ate your loaf in your sleep, you glutton, and you may starve as long as you like, but you won't get a scrap of ours.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 224160]), Text sample: Ferko was at a loss to understand how he could have eaten in his sleep, but he said nothing, and fasted all that day and the next night.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 453840]), Text sample: Then the cruel creatures laughed, and repeated what they had said the day before; but when Ferko continued to beg and beseech them, the eldest said at last, 'If you will let us put out one of your eyes and break one of your legs, then we will give you a bit of our bread.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 412080]), Text sample: At these words poor Ferko wept more bitterly than before, and bore the torments of hunger till the sun was high in the heavens; then he could stand it no longer, and he consented to allow his left eye to be put out and his left leg to be broken.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 325440]), Text sample: When this was done he stretched out his hand eagerly for the piece of bread, but his brothers gave him such a tiny scrap that the starving youth finished it in a moment and besought them for a second bit.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 198000]), Text sample: But the more Ferko wept and told his brothers that he was dying of hunger, the more they laughed and scolded him for his greed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 347040]), Text sample: So he endured the pangs of starvation all that day, but when night came his endurance gave way, and he let his right eye be put out and his right leg broken for a second piece of bread.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 210000]), Text sample: Poor Ferko ate up the scrap of bread they had left him and wept bitterly, but no one heard him or came to his help.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 240480]), Text sample: Night came on, and the poor blind youth had no eyes to close, and could only crawl along the ground, not knowing in the least where he was going.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 252240]), Text sample: But when the sun was once more high in the heavens, Ferko felt the blazing heat scorch him, and sought for some cool shady place to rest his aching limbs.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 177120]), Text sample: He climbed to the top of a hill and lay down in the grass, and as he thought under the shadow of a big tree.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 144000]), Text sample: But it was no tree he leant against, but a gallows on which two ravens were seated.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 231600]), Text sample: The one was saying to the other as the weary youth lay down, 'Is there anything the least wonderful or remarkable about this neighbourhood?'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 162240]), Text sample: 'I should just think there was,' replied the other; 'many things that don't exist anywhere else in the world.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 486240]), Text sample: There is a lake down there below us, and anyone who bathes in it, though he were at death's door, becomes sound and well on the spot, and those who wash their eyes with the dew on this hill become as sharp sighted as the eagle, even if they have been blind from their youth.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 609840]), Text sample: 'Well,' answered the first raven, 'my eyes are in no want of this healing bath, for, Heaven be praised, they are as good as ever they were; but my wing has been very feeble and weak ever since it was shot by an arrow many years ago, so let us fly at once to the lake that I may be restored to health and strength again.' And so they flew away.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 516480]), Text sample: At last it began to grow dusk, and the sun sank behind the mountains; gradually it became cooler on the hill, and the grass grew wet with dew. Then Ferko buried his face in the ground till his eyes were damp with dewdrops, and in a moment he saw clearer than he had ever done in his life before.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 159120]), Text sample: The moon was shining brightly, and lighted him to the lake where he could bathe his poor broken legs.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99120]), Text sample: Then Ferko crawled to the edge of the lake and dipped his limbs in the water.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 156240]), Text sample: He filled a bottle with the healing water, and then continued his journey in the best of spirits.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 272400]), Text sample: He had not gone far before he met a wolf, who was limping disconsolately along on three legs, and who on perceiving Ferko began to howl dismally.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 395280]), Text sample: 'My good friend,' said the youth, 'be of good cheer, for I can soon heal your leg,' and with these words he poured some of the precious water over the wolf's paw, and in a minute the animal was springing about sound and well on all fours.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 198000]), Text sample: The grateful creature thanked his benefactor warmly, and promised Ferko to do him a good turn if he should ever need it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 100320]), Text sample: Ferko continued his way till he came to a ploughed field.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 225840]), Text sample: Here he noticed a little mouse creeping wearily along on its hind paws, for its front paws had both been broken in a trap.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 216960]), Text sample: Ferko felt so sorry for the little beast that he spoke to it in the most friendly manner, and washed its small paws with the healing water.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 209041]), Text sample: In a moment the mouse was sound and whole, and after thanking the kind physician it scampered away over the ploughed furrows.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 319678]), Text sample: Ferko again proceeded on his journey, but he hadn't gone far before a queen bee flew against him, trailing one wing behind her, which had been cruelly torn in two by a big bird.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 209759]), Text sample: Ferko was no less willing to help her than he had been to help the wolf and the mouse, so he poured some healing drops over the wounded wing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 343200]), Text sample: On the spot the queen bee was cured, and turning to Ferko she said, 'I am most grateful for your kindness, and shall reward you some day.' And with these words she flew away humming, gaily.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 284161]), Text sample: Here, he thought to himself, he might as well go straight to the palace and offer his services to the King of the country, for he had heard that the King's daughter was as beautiful as the day.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 234238]), Text sample: So he went to the royal palace, and as he entered the door the first people he saw were his two brothers who had so shamefully ill treated him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 348720]), Text sample: No sooner had Ferko entered the palace than all eyes were turned on the handsome youth, and the King's daughter herself was lost in admiration, for she had never seen anyone so handsome in her life before.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 230880]), Text sample: His brothers noticed this, and envy and jealousy were added to their fear, so much so that they determined once more to destroy him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 229440]), Text sample: They went to the King and told him that Ferko was a wicked magician, who had come to the palace with the intention of carrying off the Princess.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 234481]), Text sample: And turning to the two wicked brothers he said, 'Suggest something for him to do; no matter how difficult, he must succeed in it or die.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 267360]), Text sample: They did not think long, but replied, 'Let him build your Majesty in one day a more beautiful palace than this, and if he fails in the attempt let him be hung.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 152880]), Text sample: The King was pleased with this proposal, and commanded Ferko to set to work on the following day.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 128640]), Text sample: The two brothers were delighted, for they thought they had now got rid of Ferko for ever.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 165839]), Text sample: The poor youth himself was heart broken, and cursed the hour he had crossed the boundary of the King's domain.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 409681]), Text sample: As he was wandering disconsolately about the meadows round the palace, wondering how he could escape being put to death, a little bee flew past, and settling on his shoulder whispered in his ear, 'What is troubling you, my kind benefactor?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 196560]), Text sample: Can I be of any help to you? I am the bee whose wing you healed, and would like to show my gratitude in some way.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 331440]), Text sample: Ferko recognised the queen bee, and said, 'Alas! how could you help me? for I have been set to do a task which no one in the whole world could do, let him be ever such a genius!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 146161]), Text sample: To morrow I must build a palace more beautiful than the King's, and it must be finished before evening.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 296880]), Text sample: 'Is that all?' answered the bee, 'then you may comfort yourself; for before the sun goes down to morrow night a palace shall be built unlike any that King has dwelt in before.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 423360]), Text sample: As my eyes rested on those, to me, funereal but glorious woods, which formed the background of the picture, my thoughts recurred to my father's mysterious intimations and the image of the approaching visitor; and the thought of the unknown journey saddened me.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 321360]), Text sample: When my dear mamma died I was not nine years old; and I remember, two days before the funeral, there came to Knowl, where she died, a thin little man, with large black eyes, and a very grave, dark face.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 418560]), Text sample: He was shut up a good deal with my dear father, who was in deep affliction; and mrs Rusk used to say, 'It is rather odd to see him praying with that little scarecrow from London, and good mr Clay ready at call, in the village; much good that little black whipper snapper will do him!'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 229200]), Text sample: I remember feeling a sort of awe of this little dark man; but I was not afraid of him, for he was gentle, though sad-and seemed kind.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34560]), Text sample: Come, dear; let us be going.'

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 221760]), Text sample: Thus entertained, though a little awfully, I accompanied the dark mysterious little 'whipper snapper' through the woodland glades.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 309120]), Text sample: At the sight the fountains of my grief reopened, and I cried bitterly, repeating, 'Oh! mamma, mamma, little mamma!' and so went on weeping and calling wildly on the deaf and the silent.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 146160]), Text sample: 'Sit down beside me, my child,' said the grave man with the black eyes, very kindly and gently.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 193200]), Text sample: 'Now, what do you see there?' he asked, pointing horizontally with his stick towards the centre of the opposite structure.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 258960]), Text sample: 'She is taken away!' I cried, starting up, and with streaming eyes, gazing on the building which, though I stamped my feet in my distraction, I was afraid to approach.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34080]), Text sample: Where have they brought her to?'

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 162479]), Text sample: He leaned his elbow on his knee, and his forehead on his hand, which shaded his downcast eyes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 568560]), Text sample: In that attitude he described to me a beautiful landscape, radiant with a wondrous light, in which, rejoicing, my mother moved along an airy path, ascending among mountains of fantastic height, and peaks, melting in celestial colouring into the air, and peopled with human beings translated into the same image, beauty, and splendour.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45600]), Text sample: 'Come, dear, let us go.'

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 150719]), Text sample: We can only reach it through the gate of death, to which we are all tending, young and old, with sure steps.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 197039]), Text sample: 'And where is the gate of death?' I asked in a sort of whisper, as we walked together, holding his hand, and looking stealthily.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42241]), Text sample: He smiled sadly and said-
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 165120]), Text sample: Of these Swedenborgians, indeed, I know no more than I might learn from good mrs Rusk's very inaccurate talk.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 516959]), Text sample: It is enough for me to know that their founder either saw or fancied he saw amazing visions, which, so far from superseding, confirmed and interpreted the language of the Bible; and as dear papa accepted their ideas, I am happy in thinking that they did not conflict with the supreme authority of holy writ.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 137520]), Text sample: Two little pieces of by play in which I detected her confirmed my unpleasant suspicion.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 129360]), Text sample: Her eyes were turned in the direction of the stairs, from which only she apprehended surprise.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 154320]), Text sample: She was devouring all that was passing there. I drew back into the shadow with a kind of disgust and horror.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 71280]), Text sample: She was transformed into a great gaping reptile.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 261840]), Text sample: I felt that I could have thrown something at her; but a kind of fear made me recede again toward my room. Indignation, however, quickly returned, and I came back, treading briskly as I did so.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90000]), Text sample: Madame, I suppose, had heard me, for she was half-way down the stairs.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46320]), Text sample: We shall have so pleasant walk.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 225600]), Text sample: At that moment the door of my father's study opened, and mrs Rusk, with her dark energetic face very much flushed, stepped out in high excitement.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 107280]), Text sample: Madame courtesied with a great smirk, that was full of intangible hate and insult.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 91440]), Text sample: 'Better your own brandy, if drink you must!' exclaimed mrs Rusk.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 73680]), Text sample: 'You may come to the store room now, or the butler can take it.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 71520]), Text sample: And off whisked mrs Rusk for the back staircase.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89760]), Text sample: There had been no common skirmish on this occasion, but a pitched battle.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 284880]), Text sample: Madame had made a sort of pet of Anne Wixted, an underchambermaid, and attached her to her interest economically by persuading me to make her presents of some old dresses and other things.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 241440]), Text sample: Upon this, mrs Rusk impounded the flask; and, with Anne beside her, rather precipitately appeared before 'the Master.' He heard and summoned Madame.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47520]), Text sample: Madame was cool, frank, and fluent.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43680]), Text sample: The brandy was purely medicinal.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 206160]), Text sample: Perhaps in their relations to men they are generally more trustworthy-perhaps woman's is the juster, and the other an appointed illusion.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37920]), Text sample: Madame was in high spirits.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 158400]), Text sample: The air was sweet-the landscape charming-I, so good-everything so beautiful! Where should we go?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 378000]), Text sample: I had made a resolution to speak as little as possible to Madame, I was so incensed at the treachery I had witnessed; but such resolutions do not last long with very young people, and by the time we had reached the skirts of the wood we were talking pretty much as usual.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 21840]), Text sample: 'And for what?'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34800]), Text sample: 'Poor mamma is buried there.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20160]), Text sample: I assented.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 142080]), Text sample: 'My faith, curious reason; you say because poor mamma is buried there you will not approach!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 73440]), Text sample: Let us come-even a little part of the way.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58800]), Text sample: And so I yielded, though still reluctant.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 163920]), Text sample: There was a grass grown road, which we easily reached, leading to the sombre building, and we soon arrived before it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 159600]), Text sample: She sat down on the little bank opposite, in her most languid pose-her head leaned upon the tips of her fingers.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 145680]), Text sample: 'I am fatigue-maybe you will read it aloud to me slowly and solemnly, my dearest Maud?'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 126960]), Text sample: But it would not do: she saw that I had detected her, and she laughed aloud.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 136800]), Text sample: We regard them first for the oracle of the dead, and find them after only the folly of the living.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34320]), Text sample: So I despise.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 73680]), Text sample: 'Why?' said I, flushing and growing pale again.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 101520]), Text sample: I felt quite afraid of Madame, and confounded at the suddenness of all this.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41520]), Text sample: How dark is this place!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 96240]), Text sample: How high and thick are the trees all round! and nobody comes near.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 180000]), Text sample: And Madame rolled her eyes awfully, as if she expected to see something unearthly, and, indeed, looked very like it herself.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 304320]), Text sample: 'Come away, Madame,' I said, growing frightened, and feeling that if I were once, by any accident, to give way to the panic that was gathering round me, I should instantaneously lose all control of myself.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67200]), Text sample: 'No, on the contrary, sit here by me.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 93120]), Text sample: I am not afraid of the dead people, nor of the ghosts.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41280]), Text sample: But no, you are not afraid.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 132240]), Text sample: 'Come away, Madame! you are trying to frighten me,' I said, in the childish anger which accompanies fear.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53280]), Text sample: Madame laughed an ugly laugh, and said-
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51360]), Text sample: 'Very-the kindest darling.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 214800]), Text sample: This confidential talking with Madame, strange to say, implied no confidence; it resulted from fear-it was deprecatory.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 119280]), Text sample: I treated her as if she had human sympathies, in the hope that they might be generated somehow.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78720]), Text sample: 'Yes, a Doctor Bryerly, who remained a few days.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 19440]), Text sample: Do, pray.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34560]), Text sample: 'No-I think not.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47279]), Text sample: 'And what then is his disease?'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66000]), Text sample: 'But that doctor is a doctor in theology, I fancy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 92161]), Text sample: Oh, yes-he is old man, and so uncertain life is.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 115680]), Text sample: 'There is no need of haste, Madame; it is quite time enough when his health begins to fail.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48959]), Text sample: No, no; you know everything.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90480]), Text sample: Come, tell me all about-it is for your advantage, you know.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56401]), Text sample: What is in his will, and when he wrote?'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 50880]), Text sample: 'But, Madame, I really know nothing of it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51599]), Text sample: I can't say whether there is a will or not.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 36479]), Text sample: Let us talk of something else.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39359]), Text sample: 'I know nothing of papa's will.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90959]), Text sample: You don't know, Madame, how you hurt me. Let us speak of something else.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 122880]), Text sample: With which words she seized that joint, and laughing spitefully, she twisted it suddenly back.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48479]), Text sample: I screamed while she continued to laugh.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23039]), Text sample: 'Will you tell?'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57840]), Text sample: 'Yes, yes! let me go,' I shrieked.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 118801]), Text sample: She did not release it immediately however, but continued her torture and discordant laughter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47519]), Text sample: What do you cry for, little fool?'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 92640]), Text sample: 'You've hurt me very much-you have broken my finger,' I sobbed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 26399]), Text sample: What cross girl!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 102479]), Text sample: She would not answer my questions, and affected to be very lofty and offended.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 233040]), Text sample: This did not last very long, however, and she soon resumed her wonted ways. And she returned to the question of the will, but not so directly, and with more art.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 30481]), Text sample: How could it concern her?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 22560]), Text sample: CHAPTER ten
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 59520]), Text sample: Did not she engage to make your dresses?'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72720]), Text sample: 'I-I really don't know; I rather think not.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 85920]), Text sample: She is my governess-a finishing governess, mrs Rusk says.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52320]), Text sample: I should so like to talk to her a little.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 481200]), Text sample: 'But she is ill,' I answered, and all this time I was ready to cry for vexation, thinking of my dress, which must be very absurd to elicit so much unaffected laughter from my experienced relative, and I was only longing to get away and hide myself before that handsome Captain returned.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 27120]), Text sample: 'Ill! is she?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 22080]), Text sample: what's the matter?'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 71520]), Text sample: 'A cold-feverish and rheumatic, she says.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 55200]), Text sample: 'In her room, but not in bed.'

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 418080]), Text sample: As I went along the passage, I was thinking whether my dress could be so very ridiculous as my old cousin thought it, and trying in vain to recollect any evidence of a similar contemptuous estimate on the part of that beautiful and garrulous dandy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 336480]), Text sample: I could not-quite the reverse, indeed. Still I was uncomfortable and feverish-girls of my then age will easily conceive how miserable, under similar circumstances, such a misgiving would make them.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56160]), Text sample: It was a long way to Madame's room.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 83520]), Text sample: I met mrs Rusk bustling along the passage with a housemaid.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78000]), Text sample: 'Quite well, I believe,' answered the housekeeper, drily.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43440]), Text sample: She eat enough for two to day.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 294240]), Text sample: Madame was sitting, or rather reclining, in a low arm chair, when I entered the room, close to the fire, as was her wont, her feet extended near to the bars, and a little coffee equipage beside her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 270480]), Text sample: She stuffed a book hastily between her dress and the chair, and received me in a state of langour which, had it not been for mrs Rusk's comfortable assurances, would have frightened me.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 73680]), Text sample: 'I hope you are better, Madame,' I said, approaching.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45360]), Text sample: 'And your cold, is it better?'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 320160]), Text sample: She shook her head languidly, her elbow resting on the chair, and three finger tips supporting her forehead, and then she made a little sigh, looking down from the corners of her eyes, in an interesting dejection.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 157920]), Text sample: And she winced and moaned, with her eyes closed and her hand pressed to the organ affected.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 347760]), Text sample: She was over acting; her transitions were too violent, and beside she forgot that I knew how well she could speak English, and must perceive that she was heightening the interest of her helplessness by that pretty tessellation of foreign idiom.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 106080]), Text sample: I there fore said with a kind of courage which sometimes helped me suddenly-
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 171120]), Text sample: And Madame shed some tears, which always came at call, and with her hand pressed to her ear, said very faintly,
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 156000]), Text sample: That, then, accounted for the rumble and smack of balls which I had heard as I passed the door.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 81840]), Text sample: 'Very thoughtful of you, Monica!' said my father.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 245520]), Text sample: 'Yes, and really, Austin, it is quite clear you ought to marry; you want some one to take this girl out, and look after her, and who's to do it? She's a dowdy-don't you see?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82560]), Text sample: 'Yes, you may, but not for myself, Austin-I'm not worthy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 200640]), Text sample: Do you remember little Kitty Weadon that I wanted you to marry eight and twenty years ago, or more, with a hundred and twenty thousand pounds?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 86160]), Text sample: 'I'm glad I was not the first,' said my father.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 104640]), Text sample: Her last husband, the Russian merchant, left her everything.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 95760]), Text sample: She has not a human relation, and she is in the best set.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 160800]), Text sample: 'You were always a match maker, Monica,' said my father, stopping, and putting his hand kindly on hers.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37920]), Text sample: 'But it won't do.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 223200]), Text sample: So my father, with a kind look at her, and a very tender one on me, went silently to the library, as he often did about that hour.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60240]), Text sample: Nothing I dreaded more than a step mother.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 266160]), Text sample: Good mrs Rusk and Mary Quince, in their several ways, used to enhance, by occasional anecdotes and frequent reflections, the terrors of such an intrusion.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 195599]), Text sample: I suppose they did not wish a revolution and all its consequences at Knowl, and thought it no harm to excite my vigilance.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 76079]), Text sample: But it was impossible long to be vexed with Cousin Monica.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 96481]), Text sample: 'You know, my dear, your father is an oddity,' she said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 22320]), Text sample: You must not.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72720]), Text sample: Cracky, my dear, cracky-decidedly cracky!'

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 19200]), Text sample: Poor thing!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 73681]), Text sample: Well, dear, I think I can cure that in five minutes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 276238]), Text sample: So she lighted her candle in the lobby, and with a light and agile step she scaled the stairs, I following; and having found the remedies, we approached Madame's room together.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 235199]), Text sample: I think, while we were still at the end of the gallery, Madame heard and divined our approach, for her door suddenly shut, and there was a fumbling at the handle.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42480]), Text sample: But the bolt was out of order.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 117359]), Text sample: Lady Knollys tapped at the door, saying-'we'll come in, please, and see you.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 111359]), Text sample: In doing this, he set his coat on fire, when he trampled it under foot.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 94080]), Text sample: A slow movement was tried (the Valhalla motif).

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51840]), Text sample: The interview with Dick was quite exciting.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 130080]), Text sample: Dick had just been having a great deal of trouble with Jake, and was in low spirits when they saw him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 242400]), Text sample: The statement that his old friend had become a lord, and was in danger of being an earl if he lived long enough, caused Dick to so open his eyes and mouth, and start, that his cap fell off.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 80880]), Text sample: When he picked it up, he uttered a rather singular exclamation.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 102960]), Text sample: This plainly embarrassed his lordship a little, but he bore himself bravely.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 125280]), Text sample: I didn't think I was going to like it myself, but I like it better now I'm used to it.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 324720]), Text sample: He could not believe in his good luck any more easily than the apple woman of ancient lineage could believe in hers; he walked about like a boot black in a dream; he stared at his young benefactor and felt as if he might wake up at any moment.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 126000]), Text sample: I'm sorry I'm going away to leave you, but perhaps I shall come back again when I'm an earl.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 133920]), Text sample: And if you write to me, here's where you must send your letter." And he gave him a slip of paper.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 109920]), Text sample: Dick winked his eyes also, and yet they looked rather moist about the lashes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 299040]), Text sample: He was not an educated boot black, and he would have found it difficult to tell what he felt just then if he had tried; perhaps that was why he didn't try, and only winked his eyes and swallowed a lump in his throat.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34320]), Text sample: Then he winked his eyes again.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 106320]), Text sample: Gloom had settled upon mr Hobbs; he was much depressed in spirits.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 114240]), Text sample: He laid the case on his stout knee, and blew his nose violently several times.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 156960]), Text sample: "There's something written on it," said Cedric,--"inside the case. I told the man myself what to say.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 106320]), Text sample: 'From his oldest friend, Lord Fauntleroy, to mr Hobbs.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 125280]), Text sample: When this you see, remember me.' I don't want you to forget me."

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 240240]), Text sample: "I shouldn't forget you, whoever I was among," answered his lordship. "I've spent my happiest hours with you; at least, some of my happiest hours.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68160]), Text sample: I'm sure my grandpapa would be very much pleased.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 86400]), Text sample: Perhaps he'll write and ask you, when I tell him about you.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 223920]), Text sample: At last all the preparations were complete; the day came when the trunks were taken to the steamer, and the hour arrived when the carriage stood at the door.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 185520]), Text sample: He knew something made them both sorry, though he scarcely knew what it was; but one tender little thought rose to his lips.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82079]), Text sample: "We liked this little house, Dearest, didn't we?" he said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 92640]), Text sample: "Yes-yes," she answered, in a low, sweet voice.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 242399]), Text sample: And then they went into the carriage and Cedric sat very close to her, and as she looked back out of the window, he looked at her and stroked her hand and held it close.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 92159]), Text sample: Some one was hurriedly forcing his way through this group and coming toward him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 22320]), Text sample: It was Dick.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 55680]), Text sample: He came up to Cedric quite breathless.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45118]), Text sample: "I've run all the way," he said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34558]), Text sample: Trade's been prime!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60479]), Text sample: I bought this for ye out o' what I made yesterday.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65759]), Text sample: They didn't want to let me up. It's a hankercher."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60961]), Text sample: He poured it all forth as if in one sentence.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99841]), Text sample: A bell rang, and he made a leap away before Cedric had time to speak.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 38401]), Text sample: "Good bye!" he panted.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53040]), Text sample: He stood on the wharf and waved his cap.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46320]), Text sample: Cedric held the handkerchief in his hand.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 69361]), Text sample: There was a great straining and creaking and confusion.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 77519]), Text sample: Little Lord Fauntleroy leaned forward and waved the red handkerchief.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 242160]), Text sample: OF course, as soon as the story of Lord Fauntleroy and the difficulties of the Earl of Dorincourt were discussed in the English newspapers, they were discussed in the American newspapers.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 120480]), Text sample: The story was too interesting to be passed over lightly, and it was talked of a great deal.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 125520]), Text sample: There were so many versions of it that it would have been an edifying thing to buy all the papers and compare them.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82800]), Text sample: mr Hobbs read so much about it that he became quite bewildered.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 329760]), Text sample: One said he was no relation to the Earl of Dorincourt at all, but was a small impostor who had sold newspapers and slept in the streets of New York before his mother imposed upon the family lawyer, who came to America to look for the Earl's heir.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 161040]), Text sample: But there really was nothing they could do but each write a letter to Cedric, containing assurances of their friendship and sympathy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 198720]), Text sample: They wrote those letters as soon as they could after receiving the news; and after having written them, they handed them over to each other to be read.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 348240]), Text sample: The very next morning, one of Dick's customers was rather surprised.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 254400]), Text sample: He had a shabby office near Dick's stand, and every morning Dick blacked his boots for him, and quite often they were not exactly water tight, but he always had a friendly word or a joke for Dick.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 233520]), Text sample: That particular morning, when he put his foot on the rest, he had an illustrated paper in his hand-an enterprising paper, with pictures in it of conspicuous people and things.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32400]), Text sample: "What has paralyzed you?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67440]), Text sample: Dick really did look as if something tremendous had happened.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65280]), Text sample: He pointed to the picture, under which was written:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 61920]), Text sample: "Mother of Claimant (Lady Fauntleroy)."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35040]), Text sample: "Her!" said Dick.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48960]), Text sample: "Where did you meet her, Dick?" he said.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 185760]), Text sample: The boy was out of breath with running; so much out of breath, in fact, that he could scarcely speak as he threw the paper down on the counter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56400]), Text sample: "Hello!" exclaimed mr Hobbs.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44400]), Text sample: "Look at it!" panted Dick.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45360]), Text sample: mr Hobbs dropped into his seat.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58080]), Text sample: "Done it!" cried Dick, with disgust.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 110880]), Text sample: It's BEN'S boy,--the little chap she hit when she let fly that plate at me."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 163440]), Text sample: Professor Dick Tipton had always been a sharp boy, and earning his living in the streets of a big city had made him still sharper.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 377760]), Text sample: "Well," said mr Harrison, "it will be a big thing if it turns out all right, and it will be almost as big a thing for me as for Lord Fauntleroy; and, at any rate, no harm can be done by investigating. It appears there has been some dubiousness about the child.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 119039]), Text sample: The first persons to be written to are Dick's brother and the Earl of Dorincourt's family lawyer."

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 144240]), Text sample: But what, to our eyes, may seem hopeless failure is often but the dawning of a greater success.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 144480]), Text sample: Some years ago, it was proposed to send logs from Canada to New York, by a new method.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 220320]), Text sample: The ingenious plan of mr Joggins was to bind great logs together by cables and iron girders and to tow the cargo as a raft.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 399360]), Text sample: This rare spiritual unity, this purging of all the dross of triviality as he passed through the furnace of poverty, trial, and sorrow gave eloquence to his brush and enabled him to paint as never before,--as no prosperity would have made possible.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147360]), Text sample: Failure is often the turning point, the pivot of circumstance that swings us to higher levels.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 212640]), Text sample: If that trial or deprivation has left me better, truer, nobler, then,--poverty has been riches, failure has been a success.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 431281]), Text sample: Our highest hopes, are often destroyed to prepare us for better things. The failure of the caterpillar is the birth of the butterfly; the passing of the bud is the becoming of the rose; the death or destruction of the seed is the prelude to its resurrection as wheat.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44880]), Text sample: The Nature of Hypnosis
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 512640]), Text sample: The most that can be done at this time is to explore various views which are held by leading authorities at present. It can be said, however, that a majority of authorities agree that hypnosis ensues as a result of natural laws which have been incorporated in the human organism since the beginning of man as he is today.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 75360]), Text sample: Both names loom large in the history of hypnosis.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 325680]), Text sample: Mesmer, an eighteenth century physician, believed that hypnosis occurred as a result of "vital fluids" drawn from a magnet or lodestone and which drew their unique qualities from the sun, moon and stars.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 300000]), Text sample: The former (Mesmer) thought further that metal became imbued by the solar qualities, and his system is also known as metalogy by which he meant the proper application of metals.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 195600]), Text sample: Naturally, these theories have been largely abandoned today, although there are still a few who think that hypnosis is a form of hysteria.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 501600]), Text sample: Some pioneers, notably dr William s Kroger, a psychiatrically oriented obstetrician and gynecologist who limits his practice to hypnotherapy, believe hypnosis is a conviction phenomenon which produces results that parallel the phenomena produced at Lourdes and other religious healing shrines.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 222480]), Text sample: His formula is that faith, hope, belief and expectation, all catalyzed by the imagination, lead inevitably to hypnosis.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 198240]), Text sample: This fits in perfectly, of course, with the author's already discussed visual imagery technique which requires a high degree of imagination.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 226800]), Text sample: dr Kroger, like a few others, has proved to his own satisfaction that all hypnotic phenomena can be produced at a non hypnotic level.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 245520]), Text sample: A large number of hypnotists, including the author, has come to believe that hypnosis is a semantic problem in which words are the building blocks to success.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 156000]), Text sample: Not just any words, but words which "ring a bell" or tap the experiential background of the subject.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 186240]), Text sample: This is why "sleep" continues to be in the lexicon of the hypnotist even though hypnosis is the antithesis of sleep.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147360]), Text sample: Words, of course, would be of little use without the added effect of his conditioned reflexology.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 276240]), Text sample: Probably the most widely held theory is that hypnosis is a transference phenomenon in which the prestige of the hypnotist and his relationship to the subject plays an important role.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 196560]), Text sample: This theory is bolstered by the fact that all schools of psychotherapy yield approximately the same results even though the methods differ.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 148320]), Text sample: This would logically indicate that the relationship between the therapist and the subject was the determining factor.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 148320]), Text sample: On the other hand, we know that a strong interpersonal relationship is necessary for hypnosis.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 310560]), Text sample: In the opening chapter of the book, I explained that hypnosis was a state of heightened suggestion in which the subject adopted an uncritical attitude, allowing him to accept suggestions and to take appropriate action.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 119760]), Text sample: This is excellent as far as it goes, but it does not explain how suggestion works.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 111360]), Text sample: This is the crux of the hypnotic dilemma and the answer is far from solved.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 167520]), Text sample: Hypnotists are much like those who use electricity every day of their lives, but have no idea of the nature of electricity.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78480]), Text sample: It is enough for them to know it has been harnessed for their use.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 212160]), Text sample: If there is one thing virtually certain about hypnosis it is that some parts of the brain are inhibited and other parts expanded by the process.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 634560]), Text sample: Pin point concentration is given as the reason for this selective procedure which narrows the horizon of the subject to what the hypnotist (or he, himself) is saying, screening out all other stimuli. But why is this high order of concentration so easy under hypnosis when Asians, notably the Chinese, have been trying for centuries to concentrate on one subject for as long as four or five seconds.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 152400]), Text sample: We do not know the mechanics of this metamorphosis of an ordinary brain into an organ of concentrated power.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 71040]), Text sample: It is implied that the process may be atavistic.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 328560]), Text sample: One of the newer theories-one held by dr Lewis r Wolberg, a psychoanalyst-is that hypnosis is a psychosomatic process in that it is both physiological and psychological in character.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 279360]), Text sample: Physiologically, Wolberg believes that hypnosis represents an inhibition of the higher cortical centers, and a limitation of sensory channels such as takes place in sleep.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 119280]), Text sample: He also believes that the psychological process operates through transference.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 303120]), Text sample: Others agree that it is a transference process, but that it is more of an extension of the subject's own psychic processes which is enlarged to include the voice of the hypnotist or his own thoughts or voice.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 179760]), Text sample: This is a logical conclusion and it disperses any ideas that hypnotic patients become dependent on their therapists.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 197520]), Text sample: Milton v Kline, professor of psychology at Long Island University, postulates that hypnosis is primarily retrogressive.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 411840]), Text sample: He has written that the organism functions differently on various levels of behavior (regression), and that the behavior breaks down into component parts. The theory that regression can spotlight personality disorders found in more infantile states is also widely held.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 174480]), Text sample: This is a legitimate use of regression although it is not used so much these days to uncover past traumatic incidents.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 314880]), Text sample: Actually, regression, by duplicating the exact earlier age, manner of speech and thought, etc, makes us once more as little children, a condition to be desired for certain forms of therapy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 162000]), Text sample: Others, primarily Europeans, have pointed out the analogy between the hypnotic state of animals and man.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 291120]), Text sample: Another widely held theory is that hypnosis is a state of dissociation, meaning that it constitutes a group of unconscious memories and activities which may be dredged up to replace the stream of consciousness.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 143041]), Text sample: Automaticism, of course, is inherently part of this view, and is presumed to negate volition.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 161039]), Text sample: Activity of the cerebrum, which controls the conscious and voluntary system, is rendered non operational.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 232560]), Text sample: Along the last named line, I believe that hypnotic suggestions have an autonomy of their own which supersede all else in the hypnotic situation.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 163919]), Text sample: There are many more theories I believe are partially correct, but the ones named will do for the purposes of this volume.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 303360]), Text sample: In conclusion, the author would like to take issue with those who believe that it is the monotonous intonations of the therapist that cause the subject to lapse from the deeply relaxed state into true sleep.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34320]), Text sample: Think its time to droop.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37920]), Text sample: Then begin to talk about it.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 77520]), Text sample: "Let thine heart cheer thee." Give it out let.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 170642]), Text sample: "A merry heart doeth good, like a medicine." To forget your sorrow begin to cultivate joy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74159]), Text sample: Keep away from sad people, or you will be sad.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 222960]), Text sample: A quarrel between two people to settle things, is a good deal like a dog fight in a flower bed, the only things that get settled are the flowers.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35040]), Text sample: CHAPTER fourteen
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 191760]), Text sample: Her mind leaped to enjoyment, then fell back stunned by the blow of quick remembrance, and Jane shut her eyes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 191760]), Text sample: All beautiful sights brought this pang to her heart since the reading of that paragraph on the piazza of the Mena House Hotel.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 381840]), Text sample: An hour after she had read it, she was driving down the long straight road to Cairo; embarked at Alexandria the next day; landed at Brindisi, and this night and day travelling had brought her at last within sight of the shores of England.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 201120]), Text sample: That she was going to him, Jane knew; but she felt utterly unable to arrange how or in what way her going could be managed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 228240]), Text sample: That it was a complicated problem, her common sense told her; though her yearning arms and aching bosom cried out: "O God, is it not simple?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 25680]), Text sample: MY Garth!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 243840]), Text sample: But she knew an unbiased judgment, steadier than her own, must solve the problem; and that her surest way to Garth lay through the doctor's consulting room.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 145680]), Text sample: So she telegraphed to Deryck from Paris, and at present her mind saw no further than Wimpole Street.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 195120]), Text sample: His sight is hopelessly gone, but the injured parts were progressing favourably, and all fear of brain complications seemed over.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 303120]), Text sample: "Seven pence 'apenny of this stuff ain't much for carrying all that along, I DON'T think!" grumbled his mate; and Jane's young porter experienced the double joy of faith confirmed, and willing service generously rewarded.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 18240]), Text sample: "Here, my boy!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32640]), Text sample: She tore it open.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37920]), Text sample: It was from the doctor.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37200]), Text sample: Then she turned to the window.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 22320]), Text sample: "Here, somebody!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42000]), Text sample: Fetch me a cup of coffee, will you?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 160320]), Text sample: Coffee was the last thing she wanted; but it never occurred to any one to disobey the doctor, even at a distance.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 341280]), Text sample: The young porter, who still stood sentry at the door of Jane's compartment, dashed off to the refreshment room; and, just as the train began to move, handed a cup of steaming coffee and a plate of bread and butter in at the window.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 128160]), Text sample: "Oh, thank you, my good fellow," said Jane, putting the plate on the seat, while she dived into her pocket.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 55440]), Text sample: "Here! you have done very well for me.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72480]), Text sample: Coffee at a moment's notice should fetch a fancy price.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 120240]), Text sample: The train moved on, and the porter stood looking after it with tears in his eyes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 337200]), Text sample: Over the first half crown he had said to himself: "Milk and new laid eggs." Now, as he pocketed the second, he added the other two things mentioned by the parish doctor: "Soup and jelly"; and his heart glowed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65040]), Text sample: She, also, had need of many things.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72720]), Text sample: Not of half crowns; of those she had plenty.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 168000]), Text sample: But above all else she needed just now a wise, strong, helpful friend, and Deryck had not failed her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 119040]), Text sample: How like him to think of the coffee; and oh, how like him to be coming to the station.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 75120]), Text sample: She took off her hat and leaned back against the cushions.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 168720]), Text sample: The turmoil of her soul was stilled; a great calm took its place, and Jane dropped quietly off to sleep.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 326160]), Text sample: The doctor was stationed exactly opposite the door when her carriage came to a standstill; mere chance, and yet, to Jane, it seemed so like him to have taken up his position precisely at the right spot on that long platform.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 171120]), Text sample: Then she saw behind him her aunt's footman, and her own maid, who had been given a place in the duchess's household.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 36000]), Text sample: "That is right, dear," he said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45360]), Text sample: "All fit and well, I can see.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 227041]), Text sample: I telephoned the duchess to send some of her people to meet your luggage, and not to expect you herself until dinner time, as you were taking tea with us. Was that right?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 17041]), Text sample: This way.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 29281]), Text sample: Come outside the barrier.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90960]), Text sample: Jane gave a sudden sob; then turned to him, dry eyed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37678]), Text sample: "Is there no hope, Deryck?"

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 69600]), Text sample: "Tell the empress that I accept her invitation.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 50880]), Text sample: I shall set out for Rome immediately.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 495360]), Text sample: Right off, I observed a cluster of mountains about two thousand feet high, whose shapes were very whimsically sculpted. After our position fix, I reentered the lounge, and when our bearings were reported on the chart, I saw that we were off the island of Ceylon, that pearl dangling from the lower lobe of the Indian peninsula.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 131760]), Text sample: I went looking in the library for a book about this island, one of the most fertile in the world.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 157680]), Text sample: Reentering the lounge, I first noted the bearings of Ceylon, on which antiquity lavished so many different names.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82320]), Text sample: Just then Captain Nemo and his chief officer appeared.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23520]), Text sample: "Certainly, captain."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 15840]), Text sample: "Fine.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 26640]), Text sample: It's easily done.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 93840]), Text sample: The captain said a few words to his chief officer who went out immediately.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 91200]), Text sample: With the chart under my eyes, I looked for the Gulf of Mannar.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 124560]), Text sample: I found it by the ninth parallel off the northwestern shores of Ceylon.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89760]), Text sample: To reach it we had to go all the way up Ceylon's west coast.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53040]), Text sample: No doubt we'll be arriving a little early.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 128160]), Text sample: "You mean," I said, "that such primitive methods are still all that they use?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 141360]), Text sample: "Yet it strikes me that diving suits like yours could perform yeoman service in such work."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 381360]), Text sample: "Yes, since those poor fishermen can't stay long underwater. On his voyage to Ceylon, the Englishman Percival made much of a Kaffir who stayed under five minutes without coming up to the surface, but I find that hard to believe.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 166080]), Text sample: "Yes," I said, "it's a sad occupation, and one that exists only to gratify the whims of fashion.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 109920]), Text sample: But tell me, captain, how many oysters can a boat fish up in a workday?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 251760]), Text sample: It's even said that in eighteen fourteen, when the English government went fishing on its own behalf, its divers worked just twenty days and brought up seventy six million oysters."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 29040]), Text sample: "Hardly, professor.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 122160]), Text sample: "Only one penny to those poor people who make their employers rich! That's atrocious!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 300720]), Text sample: "On that note, professor," Captain Nemo told me, "you and your companions will visit the Mannar oysterbank, and if by chance some eager fisherman arrives early, well, we can watch him at work."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 101040]), Text sample: "By the way, Professor Aronnax, you aren't afraid of sharks, are you?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49440]), Text sample: "Sharks?" I exclaimed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58320]), Text sample: "Well?" Captain Nemo went on.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 115920]), Text sample: "I admit, captain, I'm not yet on very familiar terms with that genus of fish."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 141120]), Text sample: "We're used to them, the rest of us," Captain Nemo answered. "And in time you will be too.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 380640]), Text sample: If you're invited to hunt bears in the Swiss mountains, you might say: "Oh good, I get to go bear hunting tomorrow!" If you're invited to hunt lions on the Atlas plains or tigers in the jungles of India, you might say: "Ha!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 225840]), Text sample: Now's my chance to hunt lions and tigers!" But if you're invited to hunt sharks in their native element, you might want to think it over before accepting.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 233760]), Text sample: As for Ned Land, I admit I felt less confident of his wisdom. Danger, however great, held a perennial attraction for his aggressive nature.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 209040]), Text sample: I went back to reading Sirr's book, but I leafed through it mechanically. Between the lines I kept seeing fearsome, wide open jaws.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 127681]), Text sample: "Your Captain Nemo-the devil take him-has just made us a very pleasant proposition!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 69118]), Text sample: "Oh!" I said "You know about-"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 120000]), Text sample: He did so in the most cordial terms and conducted himself like a true gentleman."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 38159]), Text sample: "He didn't tell you anything else?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 61921]), Text sample: "Nothing, sir," the Canadian replied.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 62880]), Text sample: "He said you'd already discussed this little stroll."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37440]), Text sample: "Indeed," I said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 40319]), Text sample: "Not a one, mr Naturalist.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 40320]), Text sample: You will be going with us, right?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 14880]), Text sample: "Me?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60480]), Text sample: Why yes, certainly, of course!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57840]), Text sample: I can see that you like the idea, mr Land."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 18000]), Text sample: "Yes!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63359]), Text sample: "Dangerous?" Ned Land replied.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 50880]), Text sample: "A simple trip to an oysterbank?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 145202]), Text sample: Assuredly, Captain Nemo hadn't seen fit to plant the idea of sharks in the minds of my companions.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 192479]), Text sample: For my part, I stared at them with anxious eyes, as if they were already missing a limb or two. Should I alert them?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 98880]), Text sample: Yes, surely, but I hardly knew how to go about it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42721]), Text sample: "On the fishing itself?" I asked.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51120]), Text sample: "Or on the occupational hazards that-"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 55680]), Text sample: "On the fishing," the Canadian replied.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74639]), Text sample: "Before we tackle the terrain, it helps to be familiar with it."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 220080]), Text sample: "All right, sit down, my friends, and I'll teach you everything I myself have just been taught by the Englishman h c Sirr!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 108000]), Text sample: Ned and Conseil took seats on a couch, and right off the Canadian said to me:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56159]), Text sample: "Sir, just what is a pearl exactly?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68639]), Text sample: "Are mussels included too?" the Canadian asked.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 17760]), Text sample: "Yes!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 169920]), Text sample: The mussels of certain streams in Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Saxony, Bohemia, and France."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45839]), Text sample: "Good!" the Canadian replied.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 260399]), Text sample: "But," I went on, "for secreting pearls, the ideal mollusk is the pearl oyster Meleagrina margaritifera, that valuable shellfish.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 259440]), Text sample: Pearls result simply from mother of pearl solidifying into a globular shape. Either they stick to the oyster's shell, or they become embedded in the creature's folds.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 122400]), Text sample: On the valves a pearl sticks fast; on the flesh it lies loose.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 338880]), Text sample: But its nucleus is always some small, hard object, say a sterile egg or a grain of sand, around which the mother of pearl is deposited in thin, concentric layers over several years in succession."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23760]), Text sample: "Yes, my boy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65760]), Text sample: "Did I say sharks?" I exclaimed hastily.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 122160]), Text sample: Thus they die in the open air, and by the end of ten days they've rotted sufficiently.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 201841]), Text sample: Next they're immersed in huge tanks of salt water, then they're opened up and washed. At this point the sorters begin their twofold task.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 102240]), Text sample: "Do the prices of these pearls differ depending on their size?" Conseil asked.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 348480]), Text sample: The finest pearls are called virgin pearls, or paragons; they form in isolation within the mollusk's tissue. They're white, often opaque but sometimes of opalescent transparency, and usually spherical or pear shaped.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 359760]), Text sample: The spherical ones are made into bracelets; the pear shaped ones into earrings, and since they're the most valuable, they're priced individually. The other pearls that stick to the oyster's shell are more erratically shaped and are priced by weight.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 301200]), Text sample: Finally, classed in the lowest order, the smallest pearls are known by the name seed pearls; they're priced by the measuring cup and are used mainly in the creation of embroidery for church vestments."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23522]), Text sample: "No, my friend.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 280321]), Text sample: That task is performed with eleven strainers, or sieves, that are pierced with different numbers of holes. Those pearls staying in the strainers with twenty to eighty holes are in the first order.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 120958]), Text sample: And could master tell us the profits brought in by harvesting these banks of pearl oysters?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 192958]), Text sample: "According to Sirr's book," I replied, "these Ceylon fisheries are farmed annually for a total profit of three million man eaters."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 61438]), Text sample: "Francs!" Conseil rebuked.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 29279]), Text sample: "Yes, francs!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43922]), Text sample: three million francs!" I went on.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 367201]), Text sample: "But I don't think these fisheries bring in the returns they once did. Similarly, the Central American fisheries used to make an annual profit of four million francs during the reign of King Charles the fifth, but now they bring in only two thirds of that amount.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 25919]), Text sample: "Yes, my boy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53039]), Text sample: "Cleopatra," Conseil shot back.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 71760]), Text sample: "It must have tasted pretty bad," Ned Land added.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 156000]), Text sample: "But when a little glass of vinegar is worth one million five hundred thousand francs, its taste is a small price to pay."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 244079]), Text sample: "My gallant Ned," I replied, laughing, "those were artificial pearls, ordinary glass beads whose insides were coated with Essence of Orient."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66000]), Text sample: "That Essence of Orient must sell for quite a large sum."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 30718]), Text sample: "As little as zero!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 183598]), Text sample: It comes from the scales of a European carp, it's nothing more than a silver substance that collects in the water and is preserved in ammonia.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 26402]), Text sample: It's worthless."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 117120]), Text sample: "Maybe that's why Kate Tender married somebody else," replied mr Land philosophically.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 224402]), Text sample: "But," I said, "getting back to pearls of great value, I don't think any sovereign ever possessed one superior to the pearl owned by Captain Nemo."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20640]), Text sample: "Exactly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 158640]), Text sample: "Yes," I said, "two million francs, and no doubt all it cost our captain was the effort to pick it up."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48000]), Text sample: "Ha!" Ned Land exclaimed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 21120]), Text sample: "And why not?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 85198]), Text sample: "What good would a pearl worth millions do us here on the Nautilus?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60480]), Text sample: "Here, no," Ned Land said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 106081]), Text sample: "Oh! Elsewhere!" Conseil put in, shaking his head.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 31201]), Text sample: "In fact," I said, "mr
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 19201]), Text sample: Land is right.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 218402]), Text sample: And if we ever brought back to Europe or America a pearl worth millions, it would make the story of our adventures more authentic-and much more rewarding."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56400]), Text sample: "That's how I see it," the Canadian said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 109679]), Text sample: "No," I replied quickly, "especially if one takes certain precautions."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 144240]), Text sample: "What risks would you run in a job like that?" Ned Land said. "Swallowing a few gulps of salt water?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 246000]), Text sample: "Whatever you say, Ned." Then, trying to imitate Captain Nemo's carefree tone, I asked, "By the way, gallant Ned, are you afraid of sharks?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 50640]), Text sample: "Me?" the Canadian replied.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 105600]), Text sample: "I'm a professional harpooner! It's my job to make a mockery of them!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47039]), Text sample: "So it's an issue of . . . ?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 22079]), Text sample: "In the water?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65279]), Text sample: You see, sir, these sharks are badly designed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 102000]), Text sample: They have to roll their bellies over to snap you up, and in the meantime . . ."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 50880]), Text sample: What are your feelings about these man eaters?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49679]), Text sample: "I'm afraid I must be frank with master."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 696240]), Text sample: There can be no nobler cause for which to work than the peace of righteousness; and high honor is due those serene and lofty souls who with wisdom and courage, with high idealism tempered by sane facing of the actual facts of life, have striven to bring nearer the day when armed strife between nation and nation, between class and class, between man and man shall end throughout the world.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 538320]), Text sample: The men who have stood highest in our history, as in the history of all countries, are those who scorned injustice, who were incapable of oppressing the weak, or of permitting their country, with their consent, to oppress the weak, but who did not hesitate to draw the sword when to leave it undrawn meant inability to arrest triumphant wrong.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 296400]), Text sample: During our generation this seems to have been peculiarly the case among the men who have become obsessed with the idea of obtaining universal peace by some cheap patent panacea.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 277440]), Text sample: But as yet there has been only a rudimentary beginning of the development of international tribunals of justice, and there has been no development at all of any international police power.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 398640]), Text sample: Almost every great nation has inherited certain questions, either with other nations or with sections of its own people, which it is quite impossible, in the present state of civilization, to decide as matters between private individuals can be decided.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 138960]), Text sample: During the last century at least half of the wars that have been fought have been civil and not foreign wars.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 327840]), Text sample: There are big and powerful nations which habitually commit, either upon other nations or upon sections of their own people, wrongs so outrageous as to justify even the most peaceful persons in going to war.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 436320]), Text sample: There are also weak nations so utterly incompetent either to protect the rights of foreigners against their own citizens, or to protect their own citizens against foreigners, that it becomes a matter of sheer duty for some outside power to interfere in connection with them.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 336000]), Text sample: As yet in neither case is there any efficient method of getting international action; and if joint action by several powers is secured, the result is usually considerably worse than if only one Power interfered.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 203280]), Text sample: It is almost useless to attempt to argue with these well intentioned persons, because they are suffering under an obsession and are not open to reason.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 351840]), Text sample: They rarely try to prevent their fellow countrymen from insulting or wronging the people of other nations; but they always ardently advocate that we, in our turn, shall tamely submit to wrong and insult from other nations.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 572640]), Text sample: As Americans their folly is peculiarly scandalous, because if the principles they now uphold are right, it means that it would have been better that Americans should never have achieved their independence, and better that, in eighteen sixty one, they should have peacefully submitted to seeing their country split into half a dozen jangling confederacies and slavery made perpetual.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 84480]), Text sample: China has neither a fleet nor an efficient army.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 156480]), Text sample: Japan stands on a footing of equality with European and American nations because it does possess this power.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 692640]), Text sample: China now sees Japan, Russia, Germany, England and France in possession of fragments of her empire, and has twice within the lifetime of the present generation seen her capital in the hands of allied invaders, because she in very fact realizes the ideals of the persons who wish the United States to disarm, and then trust that our helplessness will secure us a contemptuous immunity from attack by outside nations.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 327840]), Text sample: The chief trouble comes from the entire inability of these worthy people to understand that they are demanding things that are mutually incompatible when they demand peace at any price, and also justice and righteousness.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 331680]), Text sample: Important inventions, such as the applications of steam, gas, and electricity, may find their places in history; but not so the alterations, great as they may be, which have taken place in the appearance of our dining and drawing rooms.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 367921]), Text sample: To record such little matters would indeed be 'to chronicle small beer.' But, in a slight memoir like this, I may be allowed to note some of those changes in social habits which give a colour to history, but which the historian has the greatest difficulty in recovering.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 118560]), Text sample: It was appropriated to solid food, rather than to flowers, fruits, and decorations.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 274800]), Text sample: The dinners too were more homely, though not less plentiful and savoury; and the bill of fare in one house would not be so like that in another as it is now, for family receipts were held in high estimation.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 321360]), Text sample: A small writing desk, with a smaller work box, or netting case, was all that each young lady contributed to occupy the table; for the large family work basket, though often produced in the parlour, lived in the closet.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 316081]), Text sample: Gloves immaculately clean were considered requisite for its due performance, while gloves a little soiled were thought good enough for a country dance; and accordingly some prudent ladies provided themselves with two pairs for their several purposes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 215760]), Text sample: The minuet expired with the last century: but long after it had ceased to be danced publicly it was taught to boys and girls, in order to give them a graceful carriage.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 472321]), Text sample: First it dropped its iron ring and became a clog; afterwards it was fined down into the pliant galoshe-lighter to wear and more effectual to protect-a no less manifest instance of gradual improvement than Cowper indicates when he traces through eighty lines of poetry his 'accomplished sofa' back to the original three legged stool.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 292321]), Text sample: As an illustration of the purposes which a patten was intended to serve, I add the following epigram, written by Jane Austen's uncle, mr Leigh Perrot, on reading in a newspaper the marriage of Captain Foote to Miss Patten:--

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 448080]), Text sample: It was a voice now, her voice, that he was listening for; but, though it seemed that every faculty was strained and intent upon that one effort, his eyes, too, had in no degree relaxed their vigilance-and once, half grimly, half sardonically, he smiled to himself.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 194400]), Text sample: There would be an unexpected aftermath to this exodus of expensively gowned and bejewelled women with their prosperous, well groomed escorts!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 201600]), Text sample: There was the Wowzer over there-sleek, dapper, squirming in and out of the throng with the agility and stealth of a cat.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 228000]), Text sample: It was useless, futile, profitless, for the moment, at least, to disturb himself over his failure-there was the letter!

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 413760]), Text sample: Almost feverishly now he was seeking an opportunity to open and read it unobserved; an eagerness upon him that mingled exhilaration at the lure of danger with a sense of premonition that, irritably, inevitably was with him at moments such as these.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58319]), Text sample: People still passed by him-too many.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 383760]), Text sample: And then a cafe, just ahead, making a corner, gave him the opportunity that he sought. Away from the entrance, on the side street, the brilliant lights from the windows shone out on a comparatively deserted pavement.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 261360]), Text sample: The second man was even better known than the first; there was not a crook in New York but would side step Lannigan of headquarters, and do it with amazing celerity-if he could!

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54720]), Text sample: The mystery of the Gray Seal was solved!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 391680]), Text sample: It was Jimmie Dale, Jimmie Dale, Jimmie, Dale, the millionaire, the lion of society-and there was ignominy for an honoured name, and shame and disaster and convict stripes and sullen penitentiary walls-or death!

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 260880]), Text sample: He was running now, his hands clenched at his sides; his mind, working subconsciously, urging him onward in a blind, as yet unrealised, objectless way.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 300000]), Text sample: But now, too, he was Jimmie Dale again; and, apart from the slightly outthrust jaw, the tight closed lips, impassive, debonair, composed.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 450241]), Text sample: As Larry the Bat he knew every den and lair below the dead line, and he knew, too, the Wowzer's favourite haunts.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 381599]), Text sample: The Wowzer had probably not worked alone, and he and his pal, or pals, would certainly not remain uptown either to examine or divide their spoils-they would wait until they were safe somewhere in one of their hell holes on the East Side.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 189121]), Text sample: It was perhaps fifteen minutes since he had discovered the loss of the letter, and he was walking now through the heart of the Bowery.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 313199]), Text sample: Exactly how he had got there he could not have told; he had only a vague realisation that, following an intuitive sense of direction, he had lost not a second of time in making his way downtown.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90961]), Text sample: And now he found himself hesitating at the corner of a cross street.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 164400]), Text sample: Two blocks east was that dark, narrow alleyway, that side door that made the entrance to the Sanctuary.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 222961]), Text sample: He had no need to think of her. Whatever the ruin and disaster that faced him in the next few hours, she in any case was safe.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 344402]), Text sample: There was no clew to HER identity in the letter; and where he, for months on end, with even more to work upon, had failed at every turn to trace her, there was little fear that any one else would have any better success.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 25682]), Text sample: She was safe.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65762]), Text sample: As for himself-that was different.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89522]), Text sample: "Gimme a mug of suds," said Jimmie Dale, reaching for a match.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63118]), Text sample: "Glad to know youse, cull!" he exclaimed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35520]), Text sample: "Nix!" said Jimmie Dale.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42480]), Text sample: "I just blew in from Chicago.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41279]), Text sample: Used to know de Wowzer dere.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68399]), Text sample: "Sure, youse can!" returned the barkeeper heartily.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99598]), Text sample: He beat it about fifteen minutes ago, him an' Dago Jim.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 27120]), Text sample: Know de place?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34081]), Text sample: Jimmie Dale shook his head.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68402]), Text sample: "I ain't much wise to New York," he explained.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 105841]), Text sample: "I guess youse won't bump yer head none gettin' around inside."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 108000]), Text sample: Jimmie Dale nodded, grinned back, emptied his glass, and dug for a coin.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60718]), Text sample: "Forget it!" observed the barkeeper cordially.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 71280]), Text sample: "T'anks!" said Jimmie Dale gratefully, as he turned away.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 26880]), Text sample: Chang Foo's!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74400]), Text sample: Yes; he knew Chang Foo's-too well.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147120]), Text sample: Underground Chinatown-where a man's life was worth the price of an opium pill-or less!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 134400]), Text sample: Mechanically his hand slipped into his pocket and closed over the automatic that nestled there.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 220078]), Text sample: Once in-where he had to go-and the chances were even, just even, that was all, that he would ever get out.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 124081]), Text sample: Again he was tempted to return to the Sanctuary and make the attempt as Larry the Bat.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 188162]), Text sample: Larry the Bat was well enough known to enter Chang Foo's unquestioned, and-but again he shook his head and went on.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32399]), Text sample: There was not time.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 18000]), Text sample: What then?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 87841]), Text sample: Once they knew the contents of that letter-what then?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 123120]), Text sample: Buy them off for a larger amount than the many thousands offered for the capture of the Gray Seal?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41039]), Text sample: Jimmie Dale gritted his teeth.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 274802]), Text sample: That meant blackmail from them all his life, an intolerable existence, impossible, a hell on earth-the slave, at the beck and call of two of the worst criminals in New York!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 129120]), Text sample: God, if he could get that letter before it was opened-before they KNEW!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 144000]), Text sample: If he could only get the chance to fight for it-against ANY odds!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 16802]), Text sample: Life!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 651360]), Text sample: It was close upon one o'clock in the morning when Jimmie Dale stopped again-this time before a fashionable dwelling just off Central Park. And here, for perhaps the space of a minute, he surveyed the house from the sidewalk-watching, with a sort of speculative satisfaction, a man's shadow that passed constantly to and fro across the drawn blinds of one of the lower windows.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47040]), Text sample: The rest of the house was in darkness.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 119040]), Text sample: "Yes," said Jimmie Dale, nodding his head, "I rather thought so.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57600]), Text sample: The servants will have retired hours ago.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23760]), Text sample: It's safe enough."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 62160]), Text sample: He ran quickly up the steps and rang the bell.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 244080]), Text sample: A door opened almost instantly, sending a faint glow into the hall from the lighted room; a hurried step crossed the hall-and the outer door was thrown back.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 88080]), Text sample: "Well, what is it?" demanded a voice brusquely.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 217680]), Text sample: It was quite dark, too dark for either to distinguish the other's features-and Jimmie Dale's hat was drawn far down over his eyes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 225600]), Text sample: "I want to see mr Thomas h Carling, cashier of the Hudson Mercantile National Bank-it's very important," said Jimmie Dale earnestly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 55440]), Text sample: "I am mr Carling," replied the other.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20640]), Text sample: "What is it?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99840]), Text sample: "From headquarters-with a report," he said, in a low tone.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37440]), Text sample: "Well, it's about time!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 129600]), Text sample: I've been waiting up for it-though I expected you would telephone rather than this.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 14160]), Text sample: Come in!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 81840]), Text sample: "Thank you," said Jimmie Dale courteously-and stepped into the hall.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44880]), Text sample: The other closed the front door.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 133920]), Text sample: "The servants are in bed, of course," he explained, as he led the way toward the lighted room.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33120]), Text sample: "This way, please."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 337680]), Text sample: Behind the other, across the hall, Jimmie Dale followed and close at Carling's heels entered the room, which was fitted up, quite evidently regardless of cost, as a combination library and study.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 247680]), Text sample: Carling, in a somewhat pompous fashion, walked straight ahead toward the carved mahogany flat topped desk, and, as he reached it, waved his hand.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 339840]), Text sample: "Take a chair," he said, over his shoulder-and then, turning in the act of dropping into his own chair, grasped suddenly at the edge of the desk instead, and, with a low, startled cry, stared across the room.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 206400]), Text sample: Jimmie Dale was leaning back against the door that was closed now behind him-and on Jimmie Dale's face was a black silk mask.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 277680]), Text sample: For an instant neither man spoke nor moved; then Carling, spare built, dapper in evening clothes, edged back from the desk and laughed a little uncertainly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 22800]), Text sample: "Quite neat!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 27120]), Text sample: I compliment you!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67680]), Text sample: From headquarters with a report, I think you said?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 100800]), Text sample: "Which I neglected to add," said Jimmie Dale, "was to be made in private."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 120000]), Text sample: "In private, eh?"--he seemed to be sparring for time, as he smiled.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24960]), Text sample: "In private!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90240]), Text sample: You've a strange method of securing privacy, haven't you?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49440]), Text sample: A bit melodramatic, isn't it?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66960]), Text sample: Perhaps you'll be good enough to tell me who you are?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48480]), Text sample: Jimmie Dale smiled indulgently.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 59040]), Text sample: "My name is-Smith."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34800]), Text sample: "Yes," said Carling.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 30720]), Text sample: "I am very stupid.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 16560]), Text sample: Thank you.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 237120]), Text sample: I-" he had reached the other side of the room now-and with a quick, sudden movement jerked his hand to the dial of the safe that stood against the wall.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60720]), Text sample: "Please don't do that," said Jimmie Dale softly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58080]), Text sample: "It's rather a good make, that safe.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 73440]), Text sample: I dare say it would take me half an hour to open it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 79200]), Text sample: I was rather curious to know whether it was locked or not."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 55440]), Text sample: Carling's hand dropped to his side.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42240]), Text sample: "So!" he sneered.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34560]), Text sample: "That's it, is it!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 245040]), Text sample: "mr Carling," said Jimmie Dale, in a low, even tone, "unless you moderate your voice some one in the house might hear you-I am quite well aware of that.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 618960]), Text sample: But if that happens, if any one enters this room, if you make a move to touch a button, or in any other way attempt to attract attention, I'll drop you where you stand!" His hand, behind his back, extracted the key from the door lock, held it up for the other to see, then dropped it into his pocket-and his voice, cold before, rang peremptorily now.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78720]), Text sample: "Come back to the desk and sit down in that chair!" he ordered.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 123120]), Text sample: For a moment Carling hesitated; then, with a half muttered oath, obeyed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 244800]), Text sample: Jimmie Dale moved over, and stood in front of Carling on the other side of the desk-and stared silently at the immaculate, fashionably groomed figure before him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 175440]), Text sample: Under the prolonged gaze, Carling's composure, in a measure at least, seemed to forsake him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 133680]), Text sample: He began to drum nervously with his fingers on the desk, and shift uneasily in his chair.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 341040]), Text sample: And then, from first one pocket and then the other, Jimmie Dale took the two packages of banknotes, and, still with out a word, pushed them across the desk until they lay under the other's eyes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 185520]), Text sample: Carling's fingers stopped their drumming, slid to the desk edge, tightened there, and a whiteness crept into his face.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 92400]), Text sample: Then, with an effort, he jerked himself erect in his chair.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47760]), Text sample: "What's this?" he demanded hoarsely.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99840]), Text sample: "About ten thousand dollars, I should say," said Jimmie Dale slowly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34320]), Text sample: "I haven't counted it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 83280]), Text sample: Your bank was robbed this evening at closing time, I understand?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 229440]), Text sample: "Yes!" Carling's voice was excited now, the colour back in his face. "But you-how-do you mean that you are returning the money to the bank?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41760]), Text sample: "Exactly," said Jimmie Dale.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67440]), Text sample: Carling was once more the pompous bank official.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 115440]), Text sample: He leaned back and surveyed Jimmie Dale critically with his little black eyes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53520]), Text sample: "Ah, quite so!" he observed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39120]), Text sample: "That accounts for the mask.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 154080]), Text sample: Under the circumstances, it is quite impossible that you should have stolen the money yourself, and-"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 40320]), Text sample: "I didn't," said Jimmie Dale.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 38400]), Text sample: "You found it-WHERE?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53520]), Text sample: "In Moyne's home-up in Harlem."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 131280]), Text sample: "Moyne, eh?" Carling was alert, quick now, jerking out his words.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 19920]), Text sample: His pal?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33600]), Text sample: Double crossing him, eh?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 98880]), Text sample: I suppose you want a reward-we'll attend to that, of course.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33360]), Text sample: That's what we suspected.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 75121]), Text sample: "I'll telephone headquarters to make the arrest at once."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64079]), Text sample: "Just a minute," interposed Jimmie Dale gravely.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66240]), Text sample: "I want you to listen to a little story first."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 22081]), Text sample: "A story!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 73199]), Text sample: What has a story got to do with this?" snapped Carling.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56880]), Text sample: "Oh, that's the game then, eh?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64560]), Text sample: "Well, he should have thought of all that before!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57839]), Text sample: It's quite useless for you to bring it up.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 366719]), Text sample: The man has had his chance already-a better chance than any one with his record ever had before. We took him into the bank knowing that he was an ex convict, but believing that we could make an honest man of him-and this is the result."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 17760]), Text sample: "And yet-"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45359]), Text sample: "I won't have anything to do with it."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 354960]), Text sample: There was just an instant's silence; and then, with a strange, slow, creeping motion, as a panther creeps when about to spring, Jimmie Dale projected his body across the desk-far across it toward the other.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 83279]), Text sample: Your bank was robbed to night of one hundred thousand dollars.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 38880]), Text sample: There are ten thousand here.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 126000]), Text sample: "You lie!" Ashen to the lips, Carling had risen in his chair.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39600]), Text sample: "You lie!" he cried.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39840]), Text sample: I tell you, you lie!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57599]), Text sample: Jimmie Dale's lips parted ominously.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66480]), Text sample: "Sit down!" he gritted between his teeth.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 165121]), Text sample: The white in Carling's face had turned to gray, his lips were working-mechanically he sank down again in his chair.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 188880]), Text sample: Jimmie Dale still leaned over the desk, resting his weight on his right elbow, the automatic in his right hand covering Carling.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 208320]), Text sample: "There's just one reason, only one, that keeps me from putting a bullet through you while you sit there. We'll get to that in a moment.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 149280]), Text sample: For the past four years, and God knows how many before that, you've gone the pace.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 188880]), Text sample: The lavishness of this bachelor establishment of yours is common talk in New York-far in excess of a bank cashier's salary.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 161041]), Text sample: But you were supposed to be a wealthy man in your own right; and so, in reality you were-once.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 27839]), Text sample: What ARE you?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 25440]), Text sample: Shall I tell you?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 71760]), Text sample: Why don't you tell me again that I lie-Carling?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46560]), Text sample: But now the man made no answer.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 201599]), Text sample: He had sunk a little deeper in his chair-a dawning look of terror in the eyes that held, fascinated, on Jimmie Dale.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52320]), Text sample: "You cur!" said Jimmie Dale again.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 55680]), Text sample: "You cur, with your devil's work!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 153120]), Text sample: A year ago you saw this night coming-when you must have money, or face ruin and exposure.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 307200]), Text sample: Your co officials were opposed to his appointment, but you, do you remember how you pleaded to give the man his chance-and in your hellish ingenuity saw your way then out of the trap!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46800]), Text sample: An ex convict from Sing Sing!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41520]), Text sample: It was enough, wasn't it?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 197760]), Text sample: What chance had he!" Jimmie Dale paused, his left hand clenched until the skin formed whitish knobs over the knuckles.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 192721]), Text sample: Carling's tongue sought his lips, made a circuit of them-and he tried to speak, but his voice was an incoherent muttering.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 114720]), Text sample: "I'm not sure enough myself-that I could keep my hands off you much longer.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 122160]), Text sample: The actual details of how you stole the money to day do not matter-NOW.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67921]), Text sample: A little later perhaps in court-but not now.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 295680]), Text sample: You brought the parcel home, put it in that safe there-and notified the president of the bank by telephone from here of the robbery, suggesting that police headquarters be advised at once.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72719]), Text sample: He told you to go ahead and act as you saw best.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 581040]), Text sample: A little later in the evening, you took these two packages of banknotes from the rest, and with this steamship ticket-which you obtained yesterday while out at lunch by sending a district messenger boy with the money and instructions in a sealed envelope to purchase for you-you went up to the Moynes' flat in Harlem for the purpose of secreting them somewhere there.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 249599]), Text sample: You pretended to be much disappointed at finding Moyne out-you had just come for a little social visit, to get better acquainted with the home life of your employees!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 269040]), Text sample: She left you there for a moment to answer the door-and you-you"--Jimmie Dale's voice choked again-"you blot on God's earth, you slipped the money and ticket under the child's mattress!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48241]), Text sample: "You were safe enough," he rasped on.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 540481]), Text sample: And it was safer, much more circumspect on your part, not to order the flat searched at once, but only as a last resort, as it were, after you had led the police to trail him all evening and still remain without a clew-and besides, of course, not until you had planted the evidence that was to damn him and wreck his life and home!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 193921]), Text sample: You were even generous in the amount you deprived yourself of out of the hundred thousand dollars-for less would have been enough.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 260880]), Text sample: He was an ex convict, a hardened criminal caught red handed with a portion of the proceeds of robbery-he had succeeded in hiding the remainder of it too cleverly, that was all."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43921]), Text sample: Carling's face was ghastly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 105600]), Text sample: His hands went out again-again his tongue moistened his dry lips.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 21360]), Text sample: He whispered:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 97199]), Text sample: "Isn't-isn't there some-some way we can fix this?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64081]), Text sample: And then Jimmie Dale laughed-not pleasantly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 73922]), Text sample: "Yes, there's a way, Carling," he said grimly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 275282]), Text sample: "That's why I'm here." He picked up a sheet of writing paper and pushed it across the desk-then a pen, which he dipped into the inkstand, and extended to the other.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 116640]), Text sample: "The way you'll fix it will be to write out a confession exonerating Moyne."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 105120]), Text sample: Carling shrank back into his chair, his head huddling into his shoulders.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99360]), Text sample: The automatic in Jimmie Dale's hand edged forward the fraction of an inch.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45600]), Text sample: "I have not used this-yet.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82561]), Text sample: You understand now why-don't you?" he said under his breath.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54240]), Text sample: "I'm ruined-ruined as it is.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89759]), Text sample: "Some other way-some other way!" Carling was babbling.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 81601]), Text sample: "Let me out of this-for God's sake, let me out of this!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 244081]), Text sample: "Carling," said Jimmie Dale hoarsely, "I stood beside a little bed to night and looked at a baby girl-a little baby girl with golden hair, who smiled as she slept."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89282]), Text sample: Carling shivered, and passed a shaking hand across his face.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 131520]), Text sample: The automatic lifted until the muzzle was on a line with Carling's eyes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 206880]), Text sample: Carling's hand reached out, still shaking, and took the pen; and his body, dragged limply forward, hung over the desk.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 151679]), Text sample: The pen spluttered on the paper-a bead of sweat spurting from the man's forehead dropped to the sheet.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 40081]), Text sample: A minute passed-another.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 406081]), Text sample: Carling's pen travelled haltingly across the paper then, with a queer, low cry as he signed his name, he dropped the pen from his fingers, and, rising unsteadily from his chair, stumbled away from the desk toward a couch across the room.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 119520]), Text sample: An instant Jimmie Dale watched the other, then he picked up the sheet of paper.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 31922]), Text sample: "I guess it's all up.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53760]), Text sample: Moyne hadn't anything to do with it.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 378480]), Text sample: From the paper, Jimmie Dale's eyes shifted to the figure by the couch-and the paper fluttered suddenly from his fingers to the desk. Carling was reeling, clutching at his throat-a small glass vial rolled upon the carpet.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 169919]), Text sample: And then, even as Jimmie Dale sprang forward, the other pitched head long over the couch-and in a moment it was over.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 125519]), Text sample: Presently Jimmie Dale picked up the vial-and dropped it back on the floor again.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 200640]), Text sample: There was no label on it, but it needed none-the strong, penetrating odor of bitter almonds was telltale evidence enough.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 334321]), Text sample: It was prussic, or hydrocyanic acid, probably the most deadly poison and the swiftest in its action that was known to science-Carling had provided against that "some day" in his confession!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 243360]), Text sample: He held them an instant, staring at them, then methodically began to tear them into little pieces, a strange, tired smile hovering on his lips.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 169922]), Text sample: The man was dead now-there would be disgrace enough for some one to bear, a mother perhaps-who knew!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 29760]), Text sample: He opened it there.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 107282]), Text sample: Inside were nearly two dozen little packages of hundred dollar bills.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 106318]), Text sample: The other two packages that he had brought with him he added to the rest.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 222481]), Text sample: From his pocket he took out the thin metal insignia case, and with the tiny tweezers lifted up one of the gray coloured, diamond shaped paper seals.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 277201]), Text sample: He moistened the adhesive side, and, still holding it by the tweezers, dropped it on his handkerchief and pressed the seal down on the face of the topmost package of banknotes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51121]), Text sample: HUDSON MERCANTILE NATIONAL BANK,
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 87841]), Text sample: "District messenger-some way-in the morning," he murmured.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 182640]), Text sample: Jimmie Dale slipped his mask into his pocket, and, with the parcel under his arm, stepped to the door and unlocked it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 210240]), Text sample: He paused for an instant on the threshold for a single, quick, comprehensive glance around the room-then passed on out into the street.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 178802]), Text sample: At the corner he stopped to light a cigarette-and the flame of the match spurting up disclosed a face that was worn and haggard.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66720]), Text sample: I was exhausted and drugged with lack of sleep.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 29520]), Text sample: Then I sought out Carter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 161520]), Text sample: I told him what Snap and I had learned: the rays from the Moon, proving that Grantline had concentrated a considerable ore body.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 12960]), Text sample: Who was it?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34560]), Text sample: "Johnson is all right, Gregg."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 50160]), Text sample: "Does he know anything about this Grantline affair?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43440]), Text sample: The Captain ignored my questions.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49440]), Text sample: Go to bed, Gregg, you need rest."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 26400]), Text sample: I went to my cabin.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 94800]), Text sample: It was located aft, on the stern deck, near the stern watch tower.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 86640]), Text sample: The Moon had dwindled to a pin point of light beside the crescent Earth.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 76080]), Text sample: We sat at the ends, with the passengers on each of the sides.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35040]), Text sample: Big, handsome fellow, isn't he?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47520]), Text sample: And as pleasant as he is good looking.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 88800]), Text sample: His pointed face, accentuated by the pointed beard, was pallid.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 109440]), Text sample: "I am happy to meet you, sir." His voice was soft and deep.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 59760]), Text sample: A smile plucked at his thin, gray lips.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 29280]), Text sample: The ignorance-"

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60960]), Text sample: Snap introduced him as Rance Rankin.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 96480]), Text sample: An American-a quiet, blond fellow of thirty five or forty.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60240]), Text sample: I ordered my breakfast and let the argument go on.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 21120]), Text sample: "I love an argument.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56160]), Text sample: "I mean to say, I think I said too much.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41280]), Text sample: mr Rankin, you are more diplomatic."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 21360]), Text sample: Rankin laughed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37200]), Text sample: "A theatrical entertainer.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66240]), Text sample: "A nasty one!" the Englishman exclaimed.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 100560]), Text sample: There were still three seats vacant at our table; I wondered who would occupy them.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23520]), Text sample: "Why do you say that?"

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 36720]), Text sample: Carter came into the chart room.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 28560]), Text sample: You look like a ghost."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 11520]), Text sample: "But-"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42480]), Text sample: dr Frank and her brother are with her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 105840]), Text sample: They're doing all they can." He told us what had happened.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23760]), Text sample: "Wasn't it sealed?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 17280]), Text sample: "Burst it?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 142800]), Text sample: The assailant opened it somehow, and assaulted Miss Prince-shot her in the chest with a heat ray.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42000]), Text sample: But she did not see who did it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20160]), Text sample: Nor did Prince.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 133440]), Text sample: I entered cautiously, switched on the dimmer of the tube lights, and searched the room.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 96720]), Text sample: It had only a bunk, my tiny desk, a chair and clothes robe.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 12720]), Text sample: "Snap?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 13440]), Text sample: "Yes."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 40560]), Text sample: Carter cut in on us from the chart room.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 26640]), Text sample: "Stop that, you fools!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41280]), Text sample: Someone was tampering with my door!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 62880]), Text sample: But it had done its work-awakened me.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66240]), Text sample: I searched for it, pried it loose softly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 13440]), Text sample: Alert.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 110880]), Text sample: In the darkness, cylinder in hand, I crept softly from the bunk.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 28800]), Text sample: Crouched at the door.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58560]), Text sample: Upon impulse I reached for the door, jerked it open.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20640]), Text sample: No one there!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20640]), Text sample: A giant man.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 13920]), Text sample: Miko!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 59520]), Text sample: His electronized metallic robe burned my hands.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 76560]), Text sample: I lunged against him-I was almost as surprised as he.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 113520]), Text sample: The shock of my encounter, short circuited his robe; he materialized in the starlight.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51121]), Text sample: A brief, savage encounter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 61200]), Text sample: He had dropped his hydrogen torch, and tried to grip me.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20639]), Text sample: "So it's you!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32161]), Text sample: "Quiet, Gregg Haljan!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48241]), Text sample: I only want to talk."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 17040]), Text sample: It caught me.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34320]), Text sample: I fell helpless to the deck.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 188640]), Text sample: A white actinic light shot from it-caught us, bathed us. Snap had been awake; had heard the commotion of our encounter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41521]), Text sample: His voice rang shrilly: "Stop!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89039]), Text sample: I'll shoot!" His warning siren rang out to alert the ship.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39120]), Text sample: His spotlight clung to us.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42481]), Text sample: Miko ran with me a few steps.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63600]), Text sample: Then he cursed and dropped me; fled away.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58560]), Text sample: I fell like a sack of carbide to the deck.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 26880]), Text sample: "He's all right now."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 107760]), Text sample: I was in the chart room with Captain Carter, Snap and dr Frank bending over me.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65040]), Text sample: I sat up, with dr Frank vigorously rubbing me.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74400]), Text sample: "I'm all right." I told them what had happened.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52319]), Text sample: "Died!..." I leaped to my feet.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 21360]), Text sample: She repulsed him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34560]), Text sample: It struck me blank.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 251762]), Text sample: I heard myself stammering, "Why-why we must get him!" I gathered my wits; a surge of hate swept me; a wild desire for vengeance.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45841]), Text sample: "Why, by God, where is he?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 30960]), Text sample: Why don't you go get him?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54959]), Text sample: "Easy, Gregg!" dr Frank gripped me.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33601]), Text sample: The Captain said gently.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34560]), Text sample: "I'll bring him in here to you!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 36000]), Text sample: But I'll kill him, I tell you!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72000]), Text sample: We don't want him killed, not attacked, even.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 16322]), Text sample: Not yet.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44880]), Text sample: "Why did you ask the Gogoffs?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42960]), Text sample: She spoils the look of the room."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 27120]), Text sample: "Very likely.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42719]), Text sample: "Check, old boy!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35040]), Text sample: You will not forsake me?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 17280]), Text sample: PREFACE
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 354720]), Text sample: This book owes its origin to the fact that in the autumn of nineteen twenty one the authorities of Manchester College, Oxford invited me to deliver the inaugural course of a lectureship in religion newly established under the will of the late Professor Upton.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 372000]), Text sample: No conditions being attached to this appointment, it seemed a suitable opportunity to discuss, so far as possible in the language of the moment, some of the implicits which I believe to underlie human effort and achievement in the domain of the spiritual life.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 452400]), Text sample: Since my subject is not the splendor of historic sanctity but the normal life of the Spirit, as it may be and is lived in the here and now, I have done my best to describe the character and meaning of this life in the ordinary terms of present day thought, and with little or no use of the technical language of mysticism.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 437280]), Text sample: For the same reason, no attention has been given to those abnormal experiences and states of consciousness, which, too often regarded as specially "mystical," are now recognized by all competent students as representing the unfortunate accidents rather than the abiding substance of spirituality.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 253680]), Text sample: Readers of these pages will find nothing about trances, Ecstasies and other rare psychic phenomena; which sometimes indicate holiness, and sometimes only disease.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 110640]), Text sample: For information on these matters they must go to larger and more technical works.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 559440]), Text sample: My aim here is the more general one, of indicating first the characteristic experiences-discoverable within all great religions-which justify or are fundamental to the spiritual life, and the way in which these experiences may be accommodated to the world view of the modern man: and next, the nature of that spiritual life as it appears in human history.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 418800]), Text sample: The succeeding sections of the book treat in some detail the light cast on spiritual problems by mental analysis-a process which need not necessarily be conducted from the standpoint of a degraded materialism-and by recent work on the psychology of autistic thought and of suggestion.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 296640]), Text sample: Finally, the last chapter attempts to place the fact of the life of the Spirit in its relation to the social order, and to indicate some of the results which might follow upon its healthy corporate development.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 204960]), Text sample: It is superfluous to point out that each of these subjects needs, at least, a volume to itself: and to some of them I shall hope to return in the future.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 207120]), Text sample: Their treatment in the present work is necessarily fragmentary and suggestive; and is intended rather to stimulate thought, than to offer solutions.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 500640]), Text sample: Part of Chapter four has already appeared in "The Fortnightly Review" under the title "Suggestion and Religious Experience." Chapter eight incorporates several passages from an article on "Sources of Power in Human Life" originally contributed to the "Hubert Journal." These are reprinted by kind permission of the editors concerned.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 281520]), Text sample: My numerous debts to previous writers are obvious, and for the most part are acknowledged in the footnotes; the greatest, to the works of Baron Von Hugely, will be clear to all students of his writings.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 194880]), Text sample: Thanks are also due to my old friend William Scott Palmer, who read part of the manuscript and gave me much generous and valuable advice.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46560]), Text sample: ROSES AND THORNS
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 17040]), Text sample: HEMANS.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 172560]), Text sample: Margaret was once more in her morning dress, travelling quietly home with her father, who had come up to assist at the wedding.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 621120]), Text sample: If mrs Shaw had guessed at the real reason why mrs Hale did not accompany her husband, she would have showered down gowns upon her; but it was nearly twenty years since mrs Shaw had been the poor, pretty Miss Beresford, and she had really forgotten all grievances except that of the unhappiness arising from disparity of age in married life, on which she could descant by the half hour.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 165600]), Text sample: mr Hale was one of the most delightful preachers she had ever heard, and a perfect model of a parish priest.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 154080]), Text sample: Her mind and body ached now with the recollection of all she had done and said within the last forty eight hours.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 178560]), Text sample: She took her mind away with a wrench from the recollection of the past to the bright serene contemplation of the hopeful future.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 246480]), Text sample: Her eyes began to see, not visions of what had been, but the sight actually before her; her dear father leaning back asleep in the railway carriage.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 113040]), Text sample: His blue black hair was grey now, and lay thinly over his brows.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 293760]), Text sample: The bones of his face were plainly to be seen-too plainly for beauty, if his features had been less finely cut; as it was, they had a grace if not a comeliness of their own.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 234960]), Text sample: The face was in repose; but it was rather rest after weariness, than the serene calm of the countenance of one who led a placid, contented life.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 347520]), Text sample: Margaret was painfully struck by the worn, anxious expression; and she went back over the open and avowed circumstances of her father's life, to find the cause for the lines that spoke so plainly of habitual distress and depression.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 160800]), Text sample: 'Oh! if Frederick had but been a clergyman, instead of going into the navy, and being lost to us all!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49680]), Text sample: I wish I knew all about it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 271200]), Text sample: I never understood it from Aunt Shaw; I only knew he could not come back to England because of that terrible affair. Poor dear papa! how sad he looks!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 107280]), Text sample: I am so glad I am going home, to be at hand to comfort him and mamma.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 162720]), Text sample: She was ready with a bright smile, in which there was not a trace of fatigue, to greet her father when he awakened.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 120960]), Text sample: He smiled back again, but faintly, as if it were an unusual exertion.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 86640]), Text sample: His face returned into its lines of habitual anxiety.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 239280]), Text sample: He had a trick of half opening his mouth as if to speak, which constantly unsettled the form of the lips, and gave the face an undecided expression.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 355200]), Text sample: But he had the same large, soft eyes as his daughter,--eyes which moved slowly and almost grandly round in their orbits, and were well veiled by their transparent white eyelids. Margaret was more like him than like her mother.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 384240]), Text sample: If the look on her face was, in general, too dignified and reserved for one so young, now, talking to her father, it was bright as the morning,--full of dimples, and glances that spoke of childish gladness, and boundless hope in the future.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 75360]), Text sample: It was the latter part of July when Margaret returned home.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49200]), Text sample: Its people were her people.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 75600]), Text sample: Her out of doors life was perfect.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 77281]), Text sample: Her in doors life had its drawbacks.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 198961]), Text sample: With the healthy shame of a child, she blamed herself for her keenness of sight, in perceiving that all was not as it should be there.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 660960]), Text sample: Her mother-her mother always so kind and tender towards her-seemed now and then so much discontented with their situation; thought that the bishop strangely neglected his episcopal duties, in not giving mr Hale a better living; and almost reproached her husband because he could not bring himself to say that he wished to leave the parish, and undertake the charge of a larger.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 322082]), Text sample: He would sigh aloud as he answered, that if he could do what he ought in little Helstone, he should be thankful; but every day he was more overpowered; the world became more bewildering.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 612240]), Text sample: This did good for a time; but when the autumn drew on, and the weather became more changeable, her mother's idea of the unhealthiness of the place increased; and she repined even more frequently that her husband, who was more learned than mr Hume, a better parish priest than mr Houldsworth, should not have met with the preferment that these two former neighbours of theirs had done.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 193440]), Text sample: This marring of the peace of home, by long hours of discontent, was what Margaret was unprepared for.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 216961]), Text sample: She knew, and had rather revelled in the idea, that she should have to give up many luxuries, which had only been troubles and trammels to her freedom in Harley Street.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 244322]), Text sample: Her keen enjoyment of every sensuous pleasure, was balanced finely, if not overbalanced, by her conscious pride in being able to do without them all, if need were.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 113040]), Text sample: But the cloud never comes in that quarter of the horizon from which we watch for it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 217921]), Text sample: In the latter half of September, the autumnal rains and storms came on, and Margaret was obliged to remain more in the house than she had hitherto done.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 105359]), Text sample: Helstone was at some distance from any neighbours of their own standard of cultivation.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 167039]), Text sample: 'It is undoubtedly one of the most out of the way places in England,' said mrs Hale, in one of her plaintive moods.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42721]), Text sample: I'm glad we don't visit them.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43440]), Text sample: I don't like shoppy people.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 162000]), Text sample: I think we are far better off, knowing only cottagers and labourers, and people without pretence.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 238320]), Text sample: 'You must not be so fastidious, Margaret, dear!' said her mother, secretly thinking of a young and handsome mr Gorman whom she had once met at mr Hume's.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 17521]), Text sample: 'No!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 281280]), Text sample: I call mine a very comprehensive taste; I like all people whose occupations have to do with land; I like soldiers and sailors, and the three learned professions, as they call them.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 124079]), Text sample: I'm sure you don't want me to admire butchers and bakers, and candlestick makers, do you, mamma?'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 118319]), Text sample: 'But the Gormans were neither butchers nor bakers, but very respectable coach builders.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 19199]), Text sample: 'Very well.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 162960]), Text sample: Coach building is a trade all the same, and I think a much more useless one than that of butchers or bakers.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 154800]), Text sample: Oh! how tired I used to be of the drives every day in Aunt Shaw's carriage, and how I longed to walk!'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 85680]), Text sample: And walk Margaret did, in spite of the weather.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 468481]), Text sample: She was so happy out of doors, at her father's side, that she almost danced; and with the soft violence of the west wind behind her, as she crossed some heath, she seemed to be borne onwards, as lightly and easily as the fallen leaf that was wafted along by the autumnal breeze.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90721]), Text sample: But the evenings were rather difficult to fill up agreeably.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 567121]), Text sample: At one time they had tried backgammon as a resource; but as mr Hale grew to take an increasing interest in his school and his parishioners, he found that the interruptions which arose out of these duties were regarded as hardships by his wife, not to be accepted as the natural conditions of his profession, but to be regretted and struggled against by her as they severally arose.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 281280]), Text sample: So he withdrew, while the children were yet young, into his library, to spend his evenings (if he were at home), in reading the speculative and metaphysical books which were his delight.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 321601]), Text sample: When Margaret had been here before, she had brought down with her a great box of books, recommended by masters or governess, and had found the summer's day all too short to get through the reading she had to do before her return to town.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 230880]), Text sample: Now there were only the well bound little read English Classics, which were weeded out of her father's library to fill up the small book shelves in the drawing room.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 211440]), Text sample: Thomson's Seasons, Hayley's Cowper, Middleton's Cicero, were by far the lightest, newest, and most amusing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 537601]), Text sample: The book shelves did not afford much resource. Margaret told her mother every particular of her London life, to all of which mrs Hale listened with interest, sometimes amused and questioning, at others a little inclined to compare her sister's circumstances of ease and comfort with the narrower means at Helstone vicarage.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 391199]), Text sample: In one of the letters she had received before leaving Harley Street, her father had told her that they had heard from Frederick; he was still at Rio, and very well in health, and sent his best love to her; which was dry bones, but not the living intelligence she longed for.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 266162]), Text sample: She remained with her, and was devoted to her interests; always considering herself as the good and protecting fairy, whose duty it was to baffle the malignant giant, mr Hale.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 338400]), Text sample: Master Frederick had been her favorite and pride; and it was with a little softening of her dignified look and manner, that she went in weekly to arrange the chamber as carefully as if he might be coming home that very evening.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 244078]), Text sample: Margaret could not help believing that there had been some late intelligence of Frederick, unknown to her mother, which was making her father anxious and uneasy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 183360]), Text sample: His spirits were always tender and gentle, readily affected by any small piece of intelligence concerning the welfare of others.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 134880]), Text sample: He would be depressed for many days after witnessing a death bed, or hearing of any crime.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 432480]), Text sample: But now Margaret noticed an absence of mind, as if his thoughts were pre occupied by some subject, the oppression of which could not be relieved by any daily action, such as comforting the survivors, or teaching at the school in hope of lessening the evils in the generation to come.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 281042]), Text sample: And when the brilliant fourteen fine days of October came on, her cares were all blown away as lightly as thistledown, and she thought of nothing but the glories of the forest.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 244079]), Text sample: The fern harvest was over, and now that the rain was gone, many a deep glade was accessible, into which Margaret had only peeped in July and August weather.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 230640]), Text sample: Accordingly, she was busy preparing her board one morning, when Sarah, the housemaid, threw wide open the drawing room door and announced, 'mr
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24720]), Text sample: CHAPTER twelve
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 27600]), Text sample: MORNING CALLS
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 141840]), Text sample: mr Thornton had had some difficulty in working up his mother to the desired point of civility.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 153360]), Text sample: She did not often make calls; and when she did, it was in heavy state that she went through her duties.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 227520]), Text sample: Her son had given her a carriage; but she refused to let him keep horses for it; they were hired for the solemn occasions, when she paid morning or evening visits.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 254400]), Text sample: Yet Crampton was too far off for her to walk; and she had repeatedly questioned her son as to whether his wish that she should call on the Hales was strong enough to bear the expense of cab hire.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 326160]), Text sample: She would have been thankful if it had not; for, as she said, 'she saw no use in making up friendships and intimacies with all the teachers and masters in Milton; why, he would be wanting her to call on Fanny's dancing master's wife, the next thing!'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47520]), Text sample: 'Oh! you need not speak so hastily.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32160]), Text sample: I am going to morrow.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 69600]), Text sample: I only wanted you exactly to understand about it.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57120]), Text sample: 'If you are going to morrow, I shall order horses.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 28800]), Text sample: 'Nonsense, john.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41760]), Text sample: One would think you were made of money.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32880]), Text sample: 'Not quite, yet.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44160]), Text sample: But about the horses I'm determined.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 75120]), Text sample: 'I never complained of it, I'm sure.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 168480]), Text sample: My mother is not given to complaints,' said he, a little proudly. 'But so much the more I have to watch over you.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 104160]), Text sample: Now as for Fanny there, a little hardship would do her good.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 69120]), Text sample: 'She is not made of the same stuff as you are, john.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 204240]), Text sample: She could not bear it.' mrs Thornton was silent after this; for her last words bore relation to a subject which mortified her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 204720]), Text sample: She had an unconscious contempt for a weak character; and Fanny was weak in the very points in which her mother and brother were strong.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 206400]), Text sample: A stranger, a careless observer might have considered that mrs Thornton's manner to her children betokened far more love to Fanny than to john.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65760]), Text sample: But such a one would have been deeply mistaken.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 168720]), Text sample: She never called her son by any name but john; 'love,' and 'dear,' and such like terms, were reserved for Fanny.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 148800]), Text sample: But her heart gave thanks for him day and night; and she walked proudly among women for his sake.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 133440]), Text sample: 'Fanny dear I shall have horses to the carriage to day, to go and call on these Hales.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82080]), Text sample: It's in the same direction, and she's always so glad to see you.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 59040]), Text sample: You could go on there while I am at mrs Hale's.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 107040]), Text sample: 'Oh! mamma, it's such a long way, and I am so tired.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 95040]), Text sample: 'With what?' asked mrs Thornton, her brow slightly contracting.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 70320]), Text sample: 'I don't know-the weather, I think.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 40320]), Text sample: Couldn't you bring nurse here, mamma?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 121200]), Text sample: The carriage could fetch her, and she could spend the rest of the day here, which I know she would like.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 112560]), Text sample: mrs Thornton did not speak; but she laid her work on the table, and seemed to think.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 98880]), Text sample: 'It will be a long way for her to walk back at night!' she remarked, at last.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 55440]), Text sample: 'Oh, but I will send her home in a cab.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 153360]), Text sample: I never thought of her walking.' At this point, mr Thornton came in, just before going to the mill.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 17520]), Text sample: 'Mother!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 155760]), Text sample: I need hardly say, that if there is any little thing that could serve mrs Hale as an invalid, you will offer it, I'm sure.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 40320]), Text sample: 'If I can find it out, I will.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 109920]), Text sample: But I have never been ill myself, so I am not much up to invalids' fancies.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 84720]), Text sample: 'Well! here is Fanny then, who is seldom without an ailment.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 83040]), Text sample: She will be able to suggest something, perhaps-won't you, Fan?'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 138720]), Text sample: 'I have not always an ailment,' said Fanny, pettishly; 'and I am not going with mamma.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47760]), Text sample: mr Thornton looked annoyed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 114960]), Text sample: His mother's eyes were bent on her work, at which she was now stitching away busily.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 15120]), Text sample: 'Fanny!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66480]), Text sample: I wish you to go,' said he, authoritatively.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48240]), Text sample: 'It will do you good, instead of harm.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68160]), Text sample: He went abruptly out of the room after saying this.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 146640]), Text sample: 'john always speaks as if I fancied I was ill, and I am sure I never do fancy any such thing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72480]), Text sample: Who are these Hales that he makes such a fuss about?'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52560]), Text sample: 'Fanny, don't speak so of your brother.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 113280]), Text sample: He has good reasons of some kind or other, or he would not wish us to go.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44880]), Text sample: Make haste and put your things on.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39600]), Text sample: mrs Thornton was shy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 184800]), Text sample: It was only of late years that she had had leisure enough in her life to go into society; and as society she did not enjoy it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 120720]), Text sample: As dinner giving, and as criticising other people's dinners, she took satisfaction in it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99840]), Text sample: But this going to make acquaintance with strangers was a very different thing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 146640]), Text sample: She was ill at ease, and looked more than usually stern and forbidding as she entered the Hales' little drawing room.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 249840]), Text sample: Margaret was busy embroidering a small piece of cambric for some little article of dress for Edith's expected baby-'Flimsy, useless work,' as mrs Thornton observed to herself.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 106560]), Text sample: She liked mrs Hale's double knitting far better; that was sensible of its kind.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 258000]), Text sample: She made all these reflections as she was talking in her stately way to mrs Hale, and uttering all the stereotyped commonplaces that most people can find to say with their senses blindfolded.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 383520]), Text sample: mrs Hale was making rather more exertion in her answers, captivated by some real old lace which mrs Thornton wore; 'lace,' as she afterwards observed to Dixon, 'of that old English point which has not been made for this seventy years, and which cannot be bought.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 373440]), Text sample: It must have been an heir loom, and shows that she had ancestors.' So the owner of the ancestral lace became worthy of something more than the languid exertion to be agreeable to a visitor, by which mrs Hale's efforts at conversation would have been otherwise bounded.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 200401]), Text sample: And presently, Margaret, racking her brain to talk to Fanny, heard her mother and mrs Thornton plunge into the interminable subject of servants.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 93840]), Text sample: 'I suppose you are not musical,' said Fanny, 'as I see no piano.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 219600]), Text sample: 'I am fond of hearing good music; I cannot play well myself; and papa and mamma don't care much about it; so we sold our old piano when we came here.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63120]), Text sample: 'I wonder how you can exist without one.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65519]), Text sample: It almost seems to me a necessary of life.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 159120]), Text sample: 'Fifteen shillings a week, and three saved out of them!' thought Margaret to herself 'But she must have been very young.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68400]), Text sample: She probably has forgotten her own personal experience.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 185280]), Text sample: But she must know of those days.' Margaret's manner had an extra tinge of coldness in it when she next spoke.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52080]), Text sample: 'You have good concerts here, I believe.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43920]), Text sample: Too crowded, that is the worst.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 73681]), Text sample: The directors admit so indiscriminately.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58080]), Text sample: But one is sure to hear the newest music there.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 97200]), Text sample: I always have a large order to give to Johnson's, the day after a concert.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 69601]), Text sample: 'Do you like new music simply for its newness, then?'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46080]), Text sample: You have been in London, of course.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67919]), Text sample: 'Yes,' said Margaret, 'I have lived there for several years.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48000]), Text sample: 'London and the Alhambra!'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 87121]), Text sample: 'Yes! ever since I read the Tales of the Alhambra.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 28560]), Text sample: Don't you know them?'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41760]), Text sample: 'I don't think I do.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 76800]), Text sample: But surely, it is a very easy journey to London.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 153599]), Text sample: 'Yes; but somehow,' said Fanny, lowering her voice, 'mamma has never been to London herself, and can't understand my longing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 102241]), Text sample: She is very proud of Milton; dirty, smoky place, as I feel it to be.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 188400]), Text sample: 'If it has been mrs Thornton's home for some years, I can well understand her loving it,' said Margaret, in her clear bell like voice.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47041]), Text sample: 'What are you saying about me, Miss Hale?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 29519]), Text sample: May I inquire?'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 176159]), Text sample: Margaret had not the words ready for an answer to this question, which took her a little by surprise, so Miss Thornton replied:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42961]), Text sample: 'Thank you,' said mrs Thornton.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 234241]), Text sample: 'I do not feel that my very natural liking for the place where I was born and brought up,--and which has since been my residence for some years, requires any accounting for.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33600]), Text sample: Margaret was vexed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 241680]), Text sample: As Fanny had put it, it did seem as if they had been impertinently discussing mrs Thornton's feelings; but she also rose up against that lady's manner of showing that she was offended.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 55921]), Text sample: mrs Thornton went on after a moment's pause:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52319]), Text sample: 'Do you know anything of Milton, Miss Hale?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48000]), Text sample: Have you seen any of our factories?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45359]), Text sample: our magnificent warehouses?'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 310560]), Text sample: 'No!' said Margaret. 'I have not seen anything of that description as yet.' Then she felt that, by concealing her utter indifference to all such places, she was hardly speaking with truth; so she went on:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 79200]), Text sample: 'I dare say, papa would have taken me before now if I had cared.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 98399]), Text sample: But I really do not find much pleasure in going over manufactories.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 153121]), Text sample: 'They are very curious places,' said mrs Hale, 'but there is so much noise and dirt always.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 158880]), Text sample: I remember once going in a lilac silk to see candles made, and my gown was utterly ruined.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 92399]), Text sample: 'Very probably,' said mrs Thornton, in a short displeased manner.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 351599]), Text sample: 'I merely thought, that as strangers newly come to reside in a town which has risen to eminence in the country, from the character and progress of its peculiar business, you might have cared to visit some of the places where it is carried on; places unique in the kingdom, I am informed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 115919]), Text sample: 'I think I should like to know all about them, if I were you,' replied Margaret quietly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 261120]), Text sample: 'Fanny!' said her mother, as they drove away, 'we will be civil to these Hales: but don't form one of your hasty friendships with the daughter. She will do you no good, I see.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 91440]), Text sample: The mother looks very ill, and seems a nice, quiet kind of person.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99840]), Text sample: 'I thought I was doing my duty by talking to her, and trying to amuse her.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 256560]), Text sample: "Expecting American friends whom I'm so glad to find you know!" His knowledge of American friends was clearly an accident of which he was to taste the fruit to the last bitterness.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 419040]), Text sample: This apprehension, however, we hasten to add, enjoyed for him, in the immediate event, a certain merciful shrinkage; the immediate event being that, at Lancaster Gate, five minutes after his due arrival, prescribed him for eight thirty, mrs Stringham came in alone.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 294240]), Text sample: This was exactly, goodness knew, what he wanted to be; but he had never had it so largely and freely-SO supernaturally simply, for that matter-imputed to him as of easy achievement.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 377760]), Text sample: He would have liked as well to ask her how feasible she supposed it for a poor young man to resemble her at any point; but he had after all soon enough perceived that he was doing as she wished by letting his wonder show just a little as silly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 139680]), Text sample: To spare him therefore she also avoided discussion; she kept him down by refusing to quarrel with him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 198240]), Text sample: This was what she now proposed to him to enjoy, and his secret discomfort was his sense that on the whole it was what would best suit him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 192000]), Text sample: "What do you offer, what do you offer?"--the place, however muffled in convenience and decorum, constantly hummed for him with that thick irony.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 413520]), Text sample: She welcomed him genially back from the States, as to his view of which her few questions, though not coherent, were comprehensive, and he had the amusement of seeing in her, as through a clear glass, the outbreak of a plan and the sudden consciousness of a curiosity.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 364080]), Text sample: She became aware of America, under his eyes, as a possible scene for social operations; the idea of a visit to the wonderful country had clearly but just occurred to her, yet she was talking of it, at the end of a minute, as her favourite dream.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 174720]), Text sample: He didn't believe in it, but he pretended to; this helped her as well as anything else to treat him as harmless and blameless.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 206880]), Text sample: She was so engaged, with the further aid of a complete absence of allusions, when the highest effect was given her method by the beautiful entrance of Kate.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 292080]), Text sample: That was the story-that she was always, for her beneficent dragon, under arms; living up, every hour, but especially at festal hours, to the "value" mrs Lowder had attached to her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 428640]), Text sample: High and fixed, this estimate ruled on each occasion at Lancaster Gate the social scene; so that he now recognised in it something like the artistic idea, the plastic substance, imposed by tradition, by genius, by criticism, in respect to a given character, on a distinguished actress.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 415440]), Text sample: It was made up, the character, of definite elements and touches-things all perfectly ponderable to criticism; and the way for her to meet criticism was evidently at the start to be sure her make-up had had the last touch and that she looked at least no worse than usual.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 260640]), Text sample: Densher saw himself for the moment as in his purchased stall at the play; the watchful manager was in the depths of a box and the poor actress in the glare of the footlights.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 320880]), Text sample: But she PASSED, the poor performer-he could see how she always passed; her wig, her paint, her jewels, every mark of her expression impeccable, and her entrance accordingly greeted with the proper round of applause.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 510961]), Text sample: The drama, at all events, as Densher saw it, meanwhile went on-amplified soon enough by the advent of two other guests, stray gentlemen both, stragglers in the rout of the season, who visibly presented themselves to Kate during the next moments as subjects for a like impersonal treatment and sharers in a like usual mercy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 304320]), Text sample: At opposite ends of the social course, they displayed, in respect to the "figure" that each, in his way, made, one the expansive, the other the contractile effect of the perfect white waistcoat.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 250320]), Text sample: Her companion, at the last moment, had been indisposed-positively not well enough, and so had packed her off, insistently, with excuses, with wild regrets.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 319199]), Text sample: Hadn't he more or less paved the way for her by his prompt recognition of her rarity, by preceding her, in a friendly spirit-as he had the "ear" of society-with a sharp flashlight or two?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 399118]), Text sample: He met, poor Densher, these enquiries as he could, listening with interest, yet with discomfort; wincing in particular, dry journalist as he was, to find it seemingly supposed of him that he had put his pen-oh his "pen!"--at the service of private distinction.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 186000]), Text sample: The ear of society?--they were talking, or almost, as if he had publicly paragraphed a modest young lady.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 275280]), Text sample: They dreamt dreams, in truth, he appeared to perceive, that fairly waked HIM up, and he settled himself in his place both to resist his embarrassment and to catch the full revelation.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 225360]), Text sample: What touched him most nearly was that the occasion took on somehow the air of a commemorative banquet, a feast to celebrate a brilliant if brief career.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 493681]), Text sample: It was mrs Stringham, obviously, whose testimony would have been most invoked hadn't she been, as her friend's representative, rather confined to the function of inhaling the incense; so that Kate, who treated her beautifully, smiling at her, cheering and consoling her across the table, appeared benevolently both to speak and to interpret for her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 464400]), Text sample: Her little dry New England brightness-he had "sampled" all the shades of the American complexity, if complexity it were-had its actual reasons for finding relief most in silence; so that before the subject was changed he perceived (with surprise at the others) that they had given her enough of it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 310560]), Text sample: There WERE plenty of people who were nothing over there and yet were awfully taken up in England; just as-to make the balance right, thank goodness-they sometimes sent out beauties and celebrities who left the Briton cold.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78959]), Text sample: She made it indeed effective for him by suddenly addressing him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 109680]), Text sample: "You know nothing, sir-but not the least little bit-about my friend."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 361199]), Text sample: He hadn't pretended he did, but there was a purity of reproach in mrs Stringham's face and tone, a purity charged apparently with solemn meanings; so that for a little, small as had been his claim, he couldn't but feel that she exaggerated.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 399599]), Text sample: "I certainly don't know enormously much-beyond her having been most kind to me, in New York, as a poor bewildered and newly landed alien, and my having tremendously appreciated it." To which he added, he scarce knew why, what had an immediate success.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74640]), Text sample: "Remember, mrs Stringham, that you weren't then present."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 169922]), Text sample: "Ah there you are!" said Kate with much gay expression, though what it expressed he failed at the time to make out.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 100562]), Text sample: "You weren't present THEN, dearest," mrs Lowder richly concurred.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 317760]), Text sample: He met mrs Stringham's, which affected him: with her he could on occasion clear it up-a sense produced by the mute communion between them and really the beginning, as the event was to show, of something extraordinary.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 156000]), Text sample: "Oh it's precisely my point that mr Densher CAN'T have had vast opportunities." And then she smiled at him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53760]), Text sample: "I wasn't away, you know, long."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 138000]), Text sample: "Ah she's a thousand and one things!" replied the good lady, as if now to keep well with him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 30720]), Text sample: He asked nothing better.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64321]), Text sample: "She was off with you to these parts before I knew it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 40561]), Text sample: "No, of course I didn't forget her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51118]), Text sample: "Well, the impression was as deep as you like.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 202081]), Text sample: Even the joke made mrs Stringham uneasy, and her mute communion with Densher, to which we have alluded, was more and more determined by it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 163681]), Text sample: If she actually missed, at any rate, mrs Stringham's discomfort, that but showed how her own idea held her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 231120]), Text sample: It was at all events characteristic, and what was of the essence of it was grist to his scribbling mill, matter for his journalising hand.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 298799]), Text sample: That hand already, in intention, played over it, the "motive," as a sign of the season, a feature of the time, of the purely expeditious and rough and tumble nature of the social boom.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 110162]), Text sample: He had supposed himself civilised; but if this was civilisation-!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 122402]), Text sample: He HAD unearthed her, but it was they, all of them together, who had developed her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 165120]), Text sample: She was always a charmer, one of the greatest ever seen, but she wasn't the person he had "backed."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 305039]), Text sample: She was perfectly kind to Susie: it was as if she positively knew her as handicapped for any disagreement by feeling that she, Kate, had "type," and by being committed to admiration of type.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 146162]), Text sample: She would like-Milly had had it from her-to put Kate Croy in a book and see what she could so do with her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 416162]), Text sample: It would be mrs Stringham's, however, she understood, because mrs Stringham, oddly, felt that with such stuff as the strange English girl was made of, stuff that (in spite of Maud Manningham, who was full of sentiment) she had never known, there was none other to be employed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 306721]), Text sample: He met it peacefully, a little perhaps as an example to mrs Stringham-"Oh as far on as you like!" This even had its effect: mrs Stringham appropriated as much of it as might be meant for herself.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23280]), Text sample: We were safe.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33120]), Text sample: But for how short a time!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 29760]), Text sample: Is the bone broken?'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 294240]), Text sample: He knelt, and rolled down the leg of my stocking; but though he only moved my foot ever so little, it caused me sharp pain, for feeling was coming back after the first numbness of the shot.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 106800]), Text sample: And yet, if thou fear'st not, I will still try it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 245280]), Text sample: Just at the end of this flat ledge, farthest from where the bridle path leads down, but not a hundred yards from where we stand, there is a sheep track leading up the cliff.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 383280]), Text sample: For the Zigzag started off as a fair enough chalk path, but in a few paces narrowed down till it was but a whiter thread against the grey white cliff face, and afterwards turned sharply back, crossing a hundred feet direct above our heads.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 160800]), Text sample: 'Tush!' he cried; 'it is thy heart that fails thee, and 'tis too late now to change counsel.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 270720]), Text sample: We have fifteen minutes yet to win or lose with, and if we gain the cliff top in that time we shall have an hour's start, or more, for they will take all that to search the under cliff.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 146880]), Text sample: And Maskew, too, will keep them in check a little, while they try to bring the life back to so good a man.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 115920]), Text sample: But if we fall, why, we shall fall together, and outwit their cunning.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 118800]), Text sample: In a minute I knew from Elzevir's steps that he had left the turf and was upon the chalk.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 197281]), Text sample: And then the path grew steeper and steeper, and Elzevir went slower and slower, till at last he spoke:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 153120]), Text sample: 'john, I am going to stop; but open not thy eyes till I have set thee down and bid thee.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 225841]), Text sample: But have a care to keep thy outer hand near to the inner, and the balance of thy body to the cliff, for there is no room to dance hornpipes here.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 132481]), Text sample: Then he told me to stop, for that the way grew wider and he would pick me up again.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 186960]), Text sample: I shut my eyes firm again, and thus we moved along another spell, mounting still and feeling the wind still freshening.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147599]), Text sample: At length he said that we were come to the last turn of the path, and he must set me down once more.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 150000]), Text sample: But as I crept along, I relaxed care for a moment, and my eyes wandered from the cliff side and looked down.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 194161]), Text sample: Then I called out to Elzevir, and he, guessing what had come over me, cries to turn upon my side, and press my belly to the cliff.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 31680]), Text sample: Then Elzevir spoke.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 88800]), Text sample: Pluck up thy courage, keep thy eyes to the cliff, and forward.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 236880]), Text sample: Yet I could not, but answered: 'I cannot, I cannot; if I open my eyes, or move hand or foot, I shall fall on the rocks below.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 130320]), Text sample: And Elzevir, for all he was so strong, could not pull a helpless lump backwards up that path.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 109681]), Text sample: Five minutes later Elzevir stepped on to the cliff top, with me upon his back.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 232560]), Text sample: The cliff face was gleaming white, the sea tawny inshore, but purest blue outside, with the straight sunpath across it, spangled and gleaming like a mackerel's back.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 222240]), Text sample: They will not be back for some time yet, and, when they come, will not think to search closely for us hereabouts; but that we cannot risk, and must get clear away.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 390480]), Text sample: Behind one of these walls, broken down in places, but held together with straggling ivy, and buttressed here and there with a bramble bush, Elzevir put me down at length and said, 'I am beat, and can carry thee no farther for this present, though there is not now much farther to go.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 325440]), Text sample: A minute later he said: 'The boy is coming straight for the wall; we shall have to show ourselves'; and while he spoke there was a rattle of falling stones, where the boy was partly climbing and partly pulling down the dry wall, and so Elzevir stood up.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 205200]), Text sample: The boy looked frightened, and made as if he would run off, but Elzevir passed him the time of day in a civil voice, and he stopped and gave it back.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60960]), Text sample: 'Scaring rooks for Farmer Topp,' was the answer.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 55440]), Text sample: Maybe you've seen a flask in walking through the furrows?'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 141600]), Text sample: He whispered to me to lie still, so that it might not be perceived my leg was broken; and the boy replied:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 289680]), Text sample: 'No, I have seen no flask; but very like have not come the same way as you, being sent out here from Lowermoigne; and as for powder, I have little left, and must save that for the rooks, or shall get a beating for my pains.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 181200]), Text sample: 'Come,' said Elzevir, 'give me a charge or two, and there is half a crown for thee.' And he took the coin out of his pocket and showed it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 159120]), Text sample: The boy's eyes twinkled, and so would mine at so valuable a piece, and he took out from his pocket a battered cowskin flask.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 138240]), Text sample: No time was wasted in words; Elzevir had the flask in his pocket, and the boy was biting the crown.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 86642]), Text sample: 'What! have you dropped your shot flask too?' asked the boy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 221041]), Text sample: So we gained a sorry matchlock, slugs, and powder, and the boy walked off over the furrow, whistling with his hand in his pocket, and a guinea and a crown piece in his hand.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 126241]), Text sample: 'Let us move on,' said Block; 'tis but a little distance now to go, and the heat is past already.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 235200]), Text sample: We had slept longer than we thought, for the sun was westering fast, and though the rest had refreshed me, my leg had grown stiff, and hurt the more in dangling when we started again.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 174960]), Text sample: Although I knew little of these quarries, and certainly was in evil plight to take note of anything at that time, yet afterwards I learnt much about them.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 242161]), Text sample: Then from the bottom of this shaft there spread out narrow passages or tunnels, mostly six feet high, but sometimes only three or four, and in these the marble is dug.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 134639]), Text sample: Once get to the bottom safe, and we can laugh at Posse, and hue and cry, and at the King's Crown itself.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78000]), Text sample: Thus he came safe without stumble to the bottom of the pit.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 177840]), Text sample: When we got there all was dark, but he stepped off into a narrow opening on the right hand, and walked on as if he knew the way.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 325441]), Text sample: Only twice did he set me down at a turning, while he took out his tinder box and lit a match; but at length the darkness became less dark, and I saw that we were in a large cave or room, into which the light came through some opening at the far end.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32160]), Text sample: A prophetical Riddle.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 480240]), Text sample: No sooner was this enigmatical monument read over, but Gargantua, fetching a very deep sigh, said unto those that stood by, It is not now only, I perceive, that people called to the faith of the gospel, and convinced with the certainty of evangelical truths, are persecuted.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 142080]), Text sample: The monk then said, What do you think in your conscience is meant and signified by this riddle?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 55920]), Text sample: It is the style of the prophet Merlin.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 124800]), Text sample: The suborners of men are the makers of matches, which are commonly friends.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 102240]), Text sample: The waters are the heats that the players take till they sweat again.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89040]), Text sample: The cords of the rackets are made of the guts of sheep or goats.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74640]), Text sample: The globe terrestrial is the tennis ball.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 330480]), Text sample: After playing, when the game is done, they refresh themselves before a clear fire, and change their shirts; and very willingly they make all good cheer, but most merrily those that have gained.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 617040]), Text sample: The secret of our favourite restaurant, to take a case, is guarded jealously from all but a few intimates; the secret, to take a contrary case, of our infallible remedy for seasickness is thrust upon every traveller we meet, even if he be no more than a casual acquaintance about to cross the Serpentine. So with our books.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 490560]), Text sample: There are dearly loved books of which we babble to a neighbour at dinner, insisting that she shall share our delight in them; and there are books, equally dear to us, of which we say nothing, fearing lest the praise of others should cheapen the glory of our discovery.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 127920]), Text sample: The books of "Saki" were, for me at least, in the second class.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 206400]), Text sample: It was in the WESTMINSTER GAZETTE that I discovered him (I like to remember now) almost as soon as he was discoverable.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 182160]), Text sample: james', I was not too proud to take some slight but pitying interest in men of other colleges.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 569040]), Text sample: The unusual name of a freshman up at WESTMINSTER attracted my attention; I read what he had to say; and it was only by reciting rapidly with closed eyes the names of our own famous alumni, beginning confidently with Barrie and ending, now very doubtfully, with myself, that I was able to preserve my equanimity.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 146640]), Text sample: Well, I discovered him, but only to the few, the favoured, did I speak of him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 746160]), Text sample: It may have been my uncertainty (which still persists) whether he called himself Sayki, Sahki or Sakki which made me thus ungenerous of his name, or it may have been the feeling that the others were not worthy of him; but how refreshing it was when some intellectually blown up stranger said "Do you ever read Saki?" to reply, with the same pronunciation and even greater condescension: "Saki!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 62640]), Text sample: He has been my favourite author for years!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 148320]), Text sample: A strange exotic creature, this Saki, to us many others who were trying to do it too.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 120960]), Text sample: For we were so domestic, he so terrifyingly cosmopolitan.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 218160]), Text sample: While we were being funny, as planned, with collar studs and hot water bottles, he was being much funnier with werwolves and tigers.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 461040]), Text sample: In our envy we may have wondered sometimes if it were not much easier to be funny with tigers than with collar studs; if Saki's careless cruelty, that strange boyish insensitiveness of his, did not give him an unfair start in the pursuit of laughter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 207120]), Text sample: It may have been so; but, fortunately, our efforts to be funny in the Saki manner have not survived to prove it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 113760]), Text sample: What is Saki's manner, what his magic talisman?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 116400]), Text sample: Like every artist worth consideration, he had no recipe.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 366960]), Text sample: I do not think that he has that "mastery of the CONTE"--in this book at least-which some have claimed for him. Such mastery infers a passion for tidiness which was not in the boyish Saki's equipment.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 383040]), Text sample: Nor in his dialogue, delightful as it often is, funny as it nearly always is, is he the supreme master; too much does it become monologue judiciously fed, one character giving and the other taking.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 468000]), Text sample: But in comment, in reference, in description, in every development of his story, he has a choice of words, a "way of putting things" which is as inevitably his own vintage as, once tasted, it becomes the private vintage of the connoisseur.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 101760]), Text sample: Let us take a sample or two of "Saki, nineteen eleven."

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 324000]), Text sample: Still more satisfying, in the story of the man who was tattooed "from collar bone to waist line with a glowing representation of the Fall of Icarus," is the word "privilege":
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 578640]), Text sample: In both of them Clovis exercises, needlessly, his titular right of entry, but he can be removed without damage, leaving Saki at his best and most characteristic, save that he shows here, in addition to his own shining qualities, a compactness and a finish which he did not always achieve.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 124080]), Text sample: Beneath his deference and humbleness was hid the most inquisitorial maliciousness.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 193920]), Text sample: No one knew better than he how to sneak up and take a bite at a leg, or slip into the larder or steal a muzhik's chicken.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 358560]), Text sample: As for tea or sour cabbage soup, the master and the mistress themselves guzzle that. They make me sleep in the vestibule, and when their brat cries, I don't sleep at all, but have to rock the cradle.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 199920]), Text sample: Dear Grandpapa, for Heaven's sake, take me away from here, home to our village, I can't bear this any more...

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 347279]), Text sample: Adam was silent: the last words had called up a vivid image of the past, and mr Irwine left him to his thoughts, while he spoke to Bartle Massey about old mr Donnithorne's funeral and other matters of an indifferent kind.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 199680]), Text sample: A feeling, amounting to a conviction, rushed over the unhappy lady that she had seen him for the last time until it was too late.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24961]), Text sample: She was right.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56640]), Text sample: It was too late by weeks and months.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 30238]), Text sample: December came in.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 376560]), Text sample: The Alps were covered with snow; Grenoble borrowed the shade, and looked cold, and white, and sleety, and sloppy; the gutters, running through the middle of certain of the streets, were unusually black, and the people crept along especially dismal.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 443279]), Text sample: She had an invalid cap on, and a thick woolen invalid shawl, and she shook and shivered perpetually; though she had drawn so close to the wood fire that there was a danger of her petticoats igniting, and the attendant had frequently to spring up and interpose between them and the crackling logs.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 187440]), Text sample: Little did it seem to matter to Lady Isabel; she sat in one position, her countenance the picture of stony despair.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 216961]), Text sample: She had got so far about as to sit up in the windy chamber; and it seemed to be to her a matter of perfect indifference whether she ever got out of it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 321839]), Text sample: This day she had partaken of her early dinner-such as it was, for her appetite failed-and had dozed asleep in the arm chair, when a noise arose from below, like a carriage driving into the courtyard through the porte cochere.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 40560]), Text sample: It instantly aroused her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23279]), Text sample: Had he come?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54720]), Text sample: "Who is it?" she asked of the nurse.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 55921]), Text sample: Another moment, and it was flung open.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 76800]), Text sample: Sir Francis Levison approached to greet her as he came in.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 195839]), Text sample: She waved him off, begging him, in a subdued, quiet tone, not to draw too near, as any little excitement made her faint now.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 191279]), Text sample: He took a seat opposite to her, and began pushing the logs together with his boot, as he explained that he really could not get away from town before.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78961]), Text sample: "Why did you come now?" she quietly rejoined.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54481]), Text sample: "Why did I come?" repeated he.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 98880]), Text sample: "Are these all the thanks a fellow gets for travelling in this inclement weather?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 180960]), Text sample: I wish to deal with you quite unreservedly, without concealment, or deceit; I must request you so to deal with me."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 127680]), Text sample: "What do you mean by 'deal?'" he asked, settling the logs to his apparent satisfaction.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34320]), Text sample: "To speak and act.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 119520]), Text sample: Let there be plain truth between us at this interview, if there never has been before."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39840]), Text sample: "I don't understand you."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 161280]), Text sample: "Naked truth, unglossed over," she pursued, bending her eyes determinately upon him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33360]), Text sample: "It must be."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64800]), Text sample: "It is you who have thrown out the challenge, mind."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 98640]), Text sample: "Of course I meant to do so when I gave the promise," he interrupted.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 174720]), Text sample: "But no sooner had I set my foot in London than I found myself overwhelmed with business, and away from it I could not get.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 118080]), Text sample: Even now I can only remain with you a couple of days, for I must hasten back to town."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 116640]), Text sample: "You are breaking faith already," she said, after hearing him calmly to the end.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66000]), Text sample: "Your words are not words of truth, but of deceit.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 153120]), Text sample: You did not intend to be back in time for the marriage, or otherwise you would have caused it to take place ere you went at all."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 101760]), Text sample: "What fancies you do take up!" uttered Francis Levison.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 260640]), Text sample: "Some time subsequent to your departure," she quietly went on, "one of the maids was setting to rights the clothes in your dressing closet, and she brought me a letter she found in one of the pockets.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 79680]), Text sample: It contained the information that the divorce was pronounced."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 170880]), Text sample: She spoke so quietly, so apparently without feeling or passion, that Sir Francis was agreeably astonished.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67440]), Text sample: He should have less trouble in throwing off the mask.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 247440]), Text sample: But he was an ill tempered man; and to hear that the letter had been found to have the falseness of his fine protestations and promises laid bare, did not improve his temper now.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39120]), Text sample: Lady Isabel continued,--
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 202800]), Text sample: "It would have been better to have undeceived me then; to have told me that the hopes I was cherishing for the sake of the unborn child were worse than vain."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56160]), Text sample: "I did not judge so," he replied.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 125760]), Text sample: "The excited state you then appeared to be in, would have precluded your listening to any sort of reason."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63360]), Text sample: Her heart beat a little quicker; but she stilled it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 131280]), Text sample: "You deem that it was not in reason that I should aspire to be the wife of Sir Francis Levison?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99600]), Text sample: He rose and began kicking at the logs; with the heel of his boot this time.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 162480]), Text sample: "Well, Isabel, you must be aware that it is an awful sacrifice for a man in my position to marry a divorced woman."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 122400]), Text sample: The hectic flushed into her thin cheeks, but her voice sounded calm as before.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 151440]), Text sample: "When I expected or wished, for the 'sacrifice,' it was not for my own sake; I told you so then.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 28560]), Text sample: There he lies."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54240]), Text sample: He did not take the trouble to look at it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 297840]), Text sample: "I am the representative now of an ancient and respected baronetcy," he resumed, in a tone as of apology for his previous heartless words, "and to make you my wife would so offend all my family, that-"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147360]), Text sample: "Stay," interrupted Lady Isabel, "you need not trouble yourself to find needless excuses.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 257280]), Text sample: Had you taken this journey for the purpose of making me your wife, were you to propose to do so this day, and bring a clergyman into the room to perform the ceremony, it would be futile.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 205680]), Text sample: The injury to the child can never be repaired; and, for myself, I cannot imagine any fate in life worse than being compelled to pass it with you."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 270960]), Text sample: "If you have taken this aversion to me, it cannot be helped," he coldly said, inwardly congratulating himself, let us not doubt, at being spared the work of trouble he had anticipated.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 88320]), Text sample: "You made commotion enough once about me making you reparation."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 29520]), Text sample: She shook her head.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 172560]), Text sample: "All the reparation in your power to make-all the reparation that the whole world can invent could not undo my sin.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 77520]), Text sample: It and the effects must lie upon me forever."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58320]), Text sample: "You ladies should think of that beforehand."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 98160]), Text sample: "May heaven help all to do so who may be tempted as I was."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 312000]), Text sample: "If you mean that as a reproach to me, it's rather out of place," chafed Sir Francis, whose fits of ill temper were under no control, and who never, when in them, cared what he said to outrage the feelings of another.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 178320]), Text sample: "The temptation to sin, as you call it, lay not in my persuasions half so much as in your jealous anger toward your husband."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 50880]), Text sample: "Quite true," was her reply.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 149760]), Text sample: Since we are mutually on this complimentary discourse, it is of no consequence to smooth over facts."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 138720]), Text sample: "I do not understand what you would imply," she said, drawing her shawl round her with a fresh shiver.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 40080]), Text sample: "How on the wrong scent?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58560]), Text sample: "With regard to your husband and that Hare girl.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 62640]), Text sample: You were blindly, outrageously jealous of him."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57120]), Text sample: "And I say I think you are on the wrong scent.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 92640]), Text sample: I do not believe mr Carlyle ever thought of the girl-in that way."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48240]), Text sample: "What do you mean?" she gasped.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 260880]), Text sample: "They had a secret between them-not of love-a secret of business; and those interviews they had together, her dancing attendance upon him perpetually, related to that, and that alone."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 80160]), Text sample: Her face was more flushed than it had been throughout the interview.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 249360]), Text sample: He spoke quietly now, quite in an equal tone of reasoning; it was his way when the ill temper was upon him: and the calmer he spoke, the more cutting were his words.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46320]), Text sample: He need not have told her this.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 80640]), Text sample: "What was the secret?" she inquired, in a low tone.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 98880]), Text sample: "Nay, I can't explain all; they did not take me into their confidence.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 158400]), Text sample: They did not even take you; better, perhaps that they had though, as things have turned out, or seem to be turning.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 179760]), Text sample: There's some disreputable secret attaching to the Hare family, and Carlyle was acting in it, under the rose, for mrs Hare.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99600]), Text sample: She could not seek out Carlyle herself, so she sent the young lady.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 25440]), Text sample: That's all I know."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 28800]), Text sample: "How did you know it?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39360]), Text sample: "I had reason to think so."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 19920]), Text sample: "What reason?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44160]), Text sample: I must request you to tell me."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 140880]), Text sample: "I overheard scraps of their conversation now and then in those meetings, and so gathered my information."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 148800]), Text sample: "You told a different tale to me, Sir Francis," was her remark, as she turned her indignant eyes toward him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 61680]), Text sample: "All stratagems are fair in love and war."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 124560]), Text sample: Sir Francis broke it, pointing with his left thumb over his shoulder in the direction of the cradle.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 50880]), Text sample: "What have you named that young article there?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147600]), Text sample: "The name which ought to have been his by inheritance-'Francis Levison,'" was her icy answer.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 40800]), Text sample: "Let's see-how old is he now?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52560]), Text sample: "He was born on the last day of August."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 206160]), Text sample: Sir Francis threw up his arms and stretched himself, as if a fit of idleness had overtaken him; then advanced to the cradle and pulled down the clothes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 30960]), Text sample: "Who is he like, Isabel?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 31680]), Text sample: My handsome self?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 152880]), Text sample: And then remembering the resolution marked out for herself, subsided outwardly into calmness again.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34558]), Text sample: She made no reply.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 162481]), Text sample: Sir Francis put the clothes back over the sleeping child, returned to the fire, and stood a few moments with his back to it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 146161]), Text sample: "These apartments are mine now; they have been transferred into my name, and they can never again afford you accommodation.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 116640]), Text sample: Will you be so obliging-I am not strong-as to hand me that writing case?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 199440]), Text sample: Sir Francis walked to the table she indicated, which was at the far end of the great barn of a room, and taking the writing case from it, gave it to her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 137281]), Text sample: She reached her keys from the stand at her elbow, unlocked the case, and took from it some bank notes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65279]), Text sample: "I received these from you a month ago," she said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 29520]), Text sample: "They came by post."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 131039]), Text sample: "And never had the grace to acknowledge them," he returned, in a sort of mock reproachful tone.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20879]), Text sample: "Forty pounds.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37680]), Text sample: That was the amount, was it not?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 27359]), Text sample: "I believe so."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42961]), Text sample: "Allow me to return them to you.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 17760]), Text sample: Count them."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 95279]), Text sample: "Return them to me-for what?" inquired Sir Francis, in amazement.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 77281]), Text sample: Do not make my arm ache, holding out these notes to you so long!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 16081]), Text sample: Take them!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 221520]), Text sample: "I must confess I think it may be the wisest course, as things have come to this pass; for a cat and dog life, which would seemingly be ours, is not agreeable.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64800]), Text sample: Remember, though, that it is your doing, not mine.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72961]), Text sample: But you cannot think I am going to see you starve, Isabel.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 85680]), Text sample: "I beg of you to cease," she passionately interrupted.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 36481]), Text sample: "What do you take me for?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 22800]), Text sample: "Take you for!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 28082]), Text sample: Why, how can you live?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 83520]), Text sample: You have no fortune-you must receive assistance from some one."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43199]), Text sample: "I will not receive it from you.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 97200]), Text sample: In saying this, it ought to convince you that the topic may cease."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89041]), Text sample: "Your husband!" sarcastically rejoined Sir Francis.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 30240]), Text sample: "Generous man!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67200]), Text sample: A flush, deep and painful, dyed her cheeks.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44401]), Text sample: "I should have said my late husband.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57840]), Text sample: You need not have reminded me of the mistake."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 81120]), Text sample: "If you will accept nothing for yourself, you must for the child.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54719]), Text sample: I shall give you a few hundred a year with him."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 109680]), Text sample: She beat her hands before her, as if beating off the man and his words.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53280]), Text sample: "Not a farthing, now or ever.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 36959]), Text sample: Whom do you take me for?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 108961]), Text sample: What do you take me for?" she repeated, rising in her bitter mortification.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 121678]), Text sample: "If you have put me beyond the pale of the world, I am still Lord Mount Severn's daughter!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78240]), Text sample: "You did as much toward putting yourself beyond its pale as-"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23519]), Text sample: "Don't I know it?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72961]), Text sample: Have I not said so?" she sharply interrupted.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 134160]), Text sample: And then she sat, striving to calm herself, clasping together her shaking hands.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 133681]), Text sample: "Well, if you will persist in this perverse resolution, I cannot mend it," resumed Sir Francis.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 153840]), Text sample: "In a little time you may probably wish to recall it; in which case a line, addressed to me at my banker's, will-"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46079]), Text sample: Lady Isabel drew herself up.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 114241]), Text sample: "Put away those notes, if you please," she interrupted, not allowing him to finish his sentence.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 88080]), Text sample: He took out his pocket book and placed the bank notes within it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 148080]), Text sample: "Your clothes-those you left here when you went to England-you will have the goodness to order Pierre to take away this afternoon.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89279]), Text sample: And now, Sir Francis, I believe that is all: we will part."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 27600]), Text sample: Is that to be it?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34320]), Text sample: "I wish you a good day."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67199]), Text sample: "So you will not even shake hands with me, Isabel?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33359]), Text sample: "I would prefer not."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 30000]), Text sample: And thus they parted.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 86159]), Text sample: Sir Francis left the room, but not immediately the house.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 167759]), Text sample: Then he paid a visit to the landlord, and handed him, likewise a year's rent in advance, making the same remark.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 312720]), Text sample: After that, he ordered dinner at a hotel, and the same night he and Pierre departed on their journey home again, Sir Francis thanking his lucky star that he had so easily got rid of a vexatious annoyance.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 29519]), Text sample: And Lady Isabel?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 127920]), Text sample: She passed her evening alone, sitting in the same place, close to the fire and the sparks.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 192719]), Text sample: When Lady Isabel lay down to rest, she sank into a somewhat calmer sleep than she had known of late; also into a dream.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 285601]), Text sample: She thought she was back at East Lynne-not back, in one sense, but that she seemed never to have gone away from it-walking in the flower garden with mr Carlyle, while the three children played on the lawn.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 95759]), Text sample: Her arm was within her husband's, and he was relating something to her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 234000]), Text sample: What the news was, she could not remember afterward, excepting that it was connected with the office and old mr Dill, and that mr Carlyle laughed when he told it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 171121]), Text sample: They appeared to be interrupted by the crying of Archibald; and, in turning to the lawn to ask what was the matter, she awoke.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 206640]), Text sample: It was the actual crying of her own child which awoke her-this last child-the ill fated little being in the cradle beside her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 236880]), Text sample: But, for a single instant, she forgot recent events and doings, she believed she was indeed in her happy home at East Lynne, a proud woman, an honored wife.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 276720]), Text sample: They had undergone a remarkable change since our arrival at the Butcher's Shop; they now wandered about, fat, sleek, and contented, and their former voracity had completely disappeared.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 351840]), Text sample: As regards ourselves, a day or two longer made no difference; our most important article of diet, the pemmican, was practically left untouched, as for the time being dog had completely taken its place.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 199680]), Text sample: There was thus no great sign of depression to be noticed when we came back into the tent after finishing our work, and had to while away the time.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 179760]), Text sample: As I went in, I could descry Wisting a little way off kneeling on the ground, and engaged in the manufacture of cutlets.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 162240]), Text sample: The north-east wind whistled and howled, the air was thick with driving snow, and Wisting was not to be envied.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 195600]), Text sample: During the evening the wind moderated a little, and went more to the east; we went to sleep with the best hopes for the following day.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 105120]), Text sample: saturday november twenty fifth, came; it was a grand day in many respects.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 277440]), Text sample: I had already seen proofs on several occasions of the kind of men my comrades were, but their conduct that day was such that I shall never forget it, to whatever age I may live.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 109200]), Text sample: In the course of the night the wind had gone back to the north, and increased to a gale.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 181680]), Text sample: It was blowing and snowing so that when we came out in the morning we could not see the sledges; they were half snowed under.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 180480]), Text sample: We had all taken a turn outside to look at the weather, and were sitting on our sleeping bags discussing the poor prospect.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 100080]), Text sample: This is the fifth day, and it's blowing worse than ever." We all agreed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 167520]), Text sample: "Shall we try it?" No sooner was the proposal submitted than it was accepted unanimously and with acclamation.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 210240]), Text sample: All the qualities that I most admire in a man were clearly shown at that juncture: courage and dauntlessness, without boasting or big words.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 130320]), Text sample: Amid joking and chaff, everything was packed, and then -- out into the blizzard.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 233760]), Text sample: It was practically impossible to keep one's eyes open; the fine drift snow penetrated everywhere, and at times one had a feeling of being blind.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 219120]), Text sample: The tent was not only drifted up, but covered with ice, and in taking it down we had to handle it with care. so as not to break it in pieces.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 167520]), Text sample: The dogs were not much inclined to start, and it took time to get them into their harness, but at last we were ready.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 125280]), Text sample: One more glance over the camping ground to see that nothing we ought to have with us had been forgotten.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 172320]), Text sample: The fourteen dogs' carcasses that were left were piled up in a heap, and Hassel's sledge was set up against it as a mark.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 232560]), Text sample: The spare sets of dog harness, some Alpine ropes, and all our crampons for ice work, which we now thought would not be required, were left behind.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 115200]), Text sample: The last thing to be done was planting a broken ski upright by the side of the depot.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 134880]), Text sample: It was Wisting who did this, thinking, presumably, that an extra mark would do no harm.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 69840]), Text sample: That it was a happy thought the future will show.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 296640]), Text sample: And then we were off: It was a hard pull to begin with, both for men and beasts, as the high sastrugi continued towards the south, and made it extremely difficult to advance.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 131280]), Text sample: We went on like this, slowly enough, but the main thing was that we made progress.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 196320]), Text sample: Meanwhile the sastrugi grew smaller and smaller, and finally they disappeared altogether, and the surface became quite flat.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 232320]), Text sample: The surface, which had become perfectly level, had the appearance at times of sinking; in any case, one would have thought so from the pace of the sledges.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 144240]), Text sample: The wind aft, no doubt, helped the pace somewhat, but it alone could not account for the change.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 222720]), Text sample: So far the incline had not been so great as to cause uneasiness, but if it seriously began to go downhill, we should have to stop and camp.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 92640]), Text sample: We might risk falling into some chasm before we had time to pull up.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 290400]), Text sample: Strictly speaking, I should now have been going in advance, but the uneven surface at the start and the rapid pace afterwards had made it impossible to walk as fast the dogs could pull.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 181200]), Text sample: Suddenly I saw Hanssen's dogs shoot ahead, and downhill they went at the wildest pace, Wisting after them.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 132720]), Text sample: I shouted to Hanssen to stop, and he succeeded in doing so by twisting his sledge.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 98880]), Text sample: The others, who were following, stopped when they came up to him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 209760]), Text sample: We were in the middle of a fairly steep descent; what there might be below was not easy to decide, nor would we try to find out in that weather.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 106320]), Text sample: We trampled down a place for the tent in the loose snow, and soon got it up.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 228000]), Text sample: It was not a long day's march that we had done -- eleven and three quarter miles -- but we had put an end to our stay at the Butcher's Shop, and that was a great thing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 255600]), Text sample: The boiling point test that evening showed that we were ten thousand three hundred feet above the sea, and that we had thus gone down six hundred twenty feet from the Butcher's.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43199]), Text sample: We turned in and went to sleep.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 160560]), Text sample: We therefore all slept with one eye open, and we knew well that nothing could happen without our noticing it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 235921]), Text sample: The sun showed as yet like a pat of butter, and had not succeeded in dispersing the thick mists; the wind had dropped somewhat, but was still fairly strong.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 252479]), Text sample: This is, after all, the worst part of one's job -- turning out of one's good, warm sleeping bag, and standing outside for some time in thin clothes, watching the weather.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 181440]), Text sample: We knew by experience that a gleam like this, a clearing in the weather, might come suddenly, and then one had to be on the spot.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90240]), Text sample: The gleam came; it did not last long, but long enough.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 197281]), Text sample: The descent on the south was too abrupt, but on the south-east it was better and more gradual, and ended in a wide, level tract.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 190560]), Text sample: Well content with our morning's work, we turned in again and slept till six a m, when we began our morning preparations.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 182401]), Text sample: The weather, which had somewhat improved during the night, had now broken loose again, and the north easter was doing all it could.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 153839]), Text sample: After putting ample brakes on the sledge runners, we started off downhill in a south easterly direction.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 119521]), Text sample: The descent was easy and smooth, and we reached the plain without any adventure.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 184560]), Text sample: If our progress was nevertheless slow and difficult, this was due to the wretched going, which was real torture to all of us.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 112081]), Text sample: A sledge journey through the Sahara could not have offered a worse surface to move over.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 148560]), Text sample: The weather improved in the course of the day, and when we camped in the afternoon it looked quite smiling.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 259921]), Text sample: The distance according to our three sledge meters was eighteen and a half miles; taking the bad going into consideration, we had reason to be well satisfied with it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 212640]), Text sample: Our altitude came out at nine thousand four hundred seventy five feet above the sea, or a drop of eight hundred twenty five feet in the course of the day.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35041]), Text sample: This surprised me greatly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23762]), Text sample: What did it mean?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 88800]), Text sample: Something extraordinary must await us farther on, but, what?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 283200]), Text sample: november twenty seventh did not bring us the desired weather; the night was filled with sharp gusts from the north; the morning came with a slack wind, but accompanied by mist and snowfall.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 95759]), Text sample: The surface remained about the same -- possibly rather more undulating.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 165118]), Text sample: Luckily for us, the snowfall of the last few days had filled these up, so as to present a level surface.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 83519]), Text sample: It was heavy going, though better than on the previous day.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 353280]), Text sample: As we were advancing, still blindly, and fretting at the persistently thick weather, one of us suddenly called out: "Hullo, look there!" A wild, dark summit rose high out of the mass of fog to the east south-east.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 140880]), Text sample: It was not far away -- on the contrary, it seemed threateningly near and right over us.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 163919]), Text sample: We stopped and looked at the imposing sight, but Nature did not expose her objects of interest for long.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 169199]), Text sample: We continued our course in the constant expectation of finding some surprise or other in our line of route.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 115920]), Text sample: The air ahead of us was as black as pitch, as though it concealed something.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 95041]), Text sample: It could not be a storm, or it would have been already upon us.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 75601]), Text sample: Our day's march was eighteen and a half miles.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 201121]), Text sample: I see that my diary for november twenty eighth does not begin very promisingly: "Fog, fog -- and again fog.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 93600]), Text sample: Also fine falling snow, which makes the going impossible.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 330720]), Text sample: Poor beasts, they have toiled hard to get the sledges forward to day." But the day did not turn out so badly after all, as we worked our way out of this uncertainty and found out what was behind the pitch dark clouds.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 234241]), Text sample: From this mass, right across our course, ran a great, ancient glacier; the sun shone down upon it and showed us a surface full of huge irregularities.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 229440]), Text sample: On the side nearest to the mountain these disturbances were such that a hasty glance was enough to show us the impossibility of advancing that way.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 185762]), Text sample: But right in our line of route -- straight on to the glacier -- it looked, as far as we could see, as though we could get along.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 121680]), Text sample: The fog came and went, and we had to take advantage of the clear intervals to get our bearings.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 283198]), Text sample: It would, no doubt, have been better if we could have halted, set up our tent, and waited for decently clear weather, so that we might survey the ground at our ease and choose the best way.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 177601]), Text sample: That question was unanswerable; possibly a week, or even a fortnight, and we had no time for that.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 294240]), Text sample: What we could see of the glacier appeared to be pretty steep; but it was only between the south and south-east, under the new land, that the fog now and again lifted sufficiently to enable us to see anything.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 92639]), Text sample: From the south round to the west the fog lay as thick as gruel.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 126240]), Text sample: It was to the south we had to go, and there it was possible to go forward a little way.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 227279]), Text sample: It was our intention to lighten our sledges before tackling the glacier; from the little we could see of it, it was plain enough that we should have stiff work.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 102481]), Text sample: It was therefore important to have as little as possible on the sledges.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 169681]), Text sample: We set to work at once to build the depot; the snow here was excellent for this purpose -- as hard as glass.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 290400]), Text sample: In a short time an immense erection of adamantine blocks of snow rose into the air, containing provisions for five men for six days and for eighteen dogs for five days.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 75358]), Text sample: A number of small articles were also left behind.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 209760]), Text sample: It appeared to be quite isolated, and to consist of four mountains; one of these -- Mount Helmer Hanssen -- lay separated from the rest.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 180000]), Text sample: Behind this group the air had been heavy and black the whole time, showing that more land must be concealed there.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 223922]), Text sample: For that matter, the site of the depot was so well marked by its position under the foot of the glacier that we agreed it would be impossible to miss it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 100802]), Text sample: We examined the compass from time to time, and went forward cautiously.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 79922]), Text sample: We kept it going, however, by using the utmost caution.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 223682]), Text sample: Wisting came near to sounding the depth of one of these dangerous crevasses with sledge, dogs and all, as the bridge he was about to cross gave way.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 171841]), Text sample: Thanks to his presence of mind and a lightning like movement -- some would call it luck -- he managed to save himself.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 234481]), Text sample: In this way we worked up about two hundred feet, but then we came upon such a labyrinth of yawning chasms and open abysses that we could not move.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 124081]), Text sample: There was nothing to be done but to find the least disturbed spot, and set the tent there.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90961]), Text sample: As soon as this was done Hanssen and I set out to explore.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56400]), Text sample: We were roped, and therefore safe enough.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 108480]), Text sample: It required some study to find a way out of the trap we had run ourselves into.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 324240]), Text sample: Thank God we were not here while this was going on, I thought to myself, as I stood looking out over this battlefield; it must have been a spectacle like doomsday, and not on a small scale either.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 169682]), Text sample: To advance in that direction, then, was hopeless, but that was no great matter, since our way was to the south.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 207121]), Text sample: We saw well enough that this would be a difficult place to pass with sledges and dogs, but in default of anything better it would have to be done.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 197282]), Text sample: The fog prevented our seeing far, but the immediate surroundings were enough to convince us that with caution we could beat up farther.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 204000]), Text sample: The language we used about the glacier as we went was not altogether complimentary; we had endless tacking and turning to get on.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82562]), Text sample: Can anyone be surprised that we called it the Devil's Glacier?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 167282]), Text sample: At any rate, our companions acknowledged the justness of the name with ringing acclamations when we told them of it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 189840]), Text sample: This formation -- like every -- thing else on the glacier was obviously very old, and for the most part filled with snow.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 122159]), Text sample: Our companions were no less pleased with the news we brought of our prospects.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 390961]), Text sample: Our altitude that evening was eight thousand six hundred fifty feet above the sea -- that is to say, at the foot of the glacier we had reached an altitude of eight thousand four hundred fifty feet, or a drop from the Butcher's of two thousand five hundred seventy feet.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 260400]), Text sample: The beacons we had put up came to our aid, and for our final success we owe a deep debt of gratitude to our prudence and thoughtfulness in adopting this expedient.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 325682]), Text sample: They had to drive with great circumspection and patience to grapple with the kind of ground we had before us; a slight mistake might be enough to send both sledge and dogs with lightning rapidity into the next world.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 225361]), Text sample: It took, nevertheless, a remarkably short time to cover the distance we had explored on the previous evening; before we knew it, we were at Hell's Gate.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 196322]), Text sample: This was the photographer, who, in passing over this snow bridge, struck his ski into it to try the strength of the support.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 250321]), Text sample: Close to the tracks can be seen an open piece of the crevasse; it is a pale blue at the top, but ends in the deepest black -- in a bottomless abyss.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 161039]), Text sample: The two small black figures in the distance, on the right, are Hassel and I, who are reconnoitring ahead.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 188402]), Text sample: But, taking into account all the turns and circuits we had been compelled to make, it was not so short after all.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 157682]), Text sample: It was a fairy landscape in blue and white, red and black, a play of colours that defies description.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78241]), Text sample: Some were sharp, but most were long and rounded.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33120]), Text sample: "But where is your crook?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60960]), Text sample: "Of course; do not the sheep know you?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 235920]), Text sample: Nothing was left to each sheep but a wee little stump where a tail should be, and Little Bo Peep was so heart broken that she sat down beside them and sobbed bitterly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 18240]), Text sample: And now
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 21840]), Text sample: CHAPTER nine
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 25920]), Text sample: THE PEOPLE MARCH
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 203040]), Text sample: He became aware of someone urging a glass of clear fluid upon his attention, looked up and discovered this was a dark young man in a yellow garment.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82320]), Text sample: He took the dose forthwith, and in a moment he was glowing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 161520]), Text sample: This man was shouting close to his ear and yet what was said was indistinct because of the tremendous uproar from the great theatre.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 161520]), Text sample: Behind the man was a girl in a silvery grey robe, whom Graham, even in this confusion, perceived to be beautiful.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 526080]), Text sample: Her dark eyes, full of wonder and curiosity, were fixed on him, her lips trembled apart. A partially opened door gave a glimpse of the crowded hall, and admitted a vast uneven tumult, a hammering, clapping and shouting that died away and began again, and rose to a thunderous pitch, and so continued intermittently all the time that Graham remained in the little room.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 111360]), Text sample: He watched the lips of the man in black and gathered that he was making some explanation.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 175440]), Text sample: He stared stupidly for some moments at these things and then stood up abruptly; he grasped the arm of this shouting person.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 26400]), Text sample: "Tell me!" he cried.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58080]), Text sample: The others came nearer to hear his words.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48960]), Text sample: "They have told him nothing!" cried the girl.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60720]), Text sample: "Tell me, tell me!" cried Graham.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 36960]), Text sample: He lifted his voice again.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41280]), Text sample: Why should they try to drug me?"

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 105360]), Text sample: Graham stood, his intelligence clinging helplessly to the thing he had just heard.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 128640]), Text sample: "The Council," he repeated blankly, and then snatched at a name that had struck him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 62400]), Text sample: "In my name?--And you?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35520]), Text sample: Why is he not here?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54240]), Text sample: "He-has deputed us.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 150960]), Text sample: Graham's mind was like a night of moon and swift clouds, now dark and hopeless, now clear and ghastly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 148800]), Text sample: He was Master of the Earth, he was a man sodden with thawing snow.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72000]), Text sample: The other side had imprisoned him, debated his death.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 83040]), Text sample: These shouting thousands beyond the little doorway had rescued him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 80160]), Text sample: But why these things should be so he could not understand.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 174240]), Text sample: The door opened, Lincoln's voice was swept away and drowned, and a rash of people followed on the heels of the tumult.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 93360]), Text sample: These intruders came towards him and Lincoln gesticulating.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 62400]), Text sample: The voices without explained their soundless lips.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 109200]), Text sample: "Show us the Sleeper, show us the Sleeper!" was the burden of the uproar.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46080]), Text sample: Men were bawling for "Order!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23760]), Text sample: Silence!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 69600]), Text sample: He met the wonder and expectation of the girl's eyes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 62880]), Text sample: What did these people expect from him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 146880]), Text sample: He was dimly aware that the tumult outside had changed its character, was in some way beating, marching.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 40800]), Text sample: His own mind, too, changed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66000]), Text sample: But a moment that was near to panic passed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82800]), Text sample: He tried to make audible inquiries of what was required of him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 80640]), Text sample: Lincoln was shouting in his ear, but Graham was deafened to that.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51600]), Text sample: He perceived what had happened to the uproar.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60480]), Text sample: The whole mass of people was chanting together.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 378720]), Text sample: It was not simply a song, the voices were gathered together and upborne by a torrent of instrumental music, music like the music of an organ, a woven texture of sounds, full of trumpets, full of flaunting banners, full of the march and pageantry of opening war.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 91440]), Text sample: And the feet of the people were beating time-tramp, tramp.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34080]), Text sample: He obeyed mechanically.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 94560]), Text sample: The strength of that chant took hold of him, stirred him, emboldened him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42480]), Text sample: "Wave your arm to them," said Lincoln.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 25680]), Text sample: "Wave your arm to them."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 244080]), Text sample: "This," said a voice on the other side, "he must have this." Arms were about his neck detaining him in the doorway, and a black subtly folding mantle hung from his shoulders.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 61681]), Text sample: He threw his arm free of this and followed Lincoln.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 118800]), Text sample: He perceived the girl in grey close to him, her face lit, her gesture onward.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39600]), Text sample: He emerged in the alcove again.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 284160]), Text sample: Incontinently the mounting waves of the song broke upon his appearing, and flashed up into a foam of shouting. Guided by Lincoln's hand he marched obliquely across the centre of the stage facing the people.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 227759]), Text sample: The hall was a vast and intricate space-galleries, balconies, broad spaces of amphitheatral steps, and great archways.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 134159]), Text sample: Far away, high up, seemed the mouth of a huge passage full of struggling humanity.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 343440]), Text sample: Individual figures sprang out of the tumult, impressed him momentarily, and lost definition again. Close to the platform swayed a beautiful fair woman, carried by three men, her hair across her face and brandishing a green staff.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 126481]), Text sample: The multitude were beating time with their feet-marking time, tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65521]), Text sample: He raised his arm, and the roaring was redoubled.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89279]), Text sample: He waved his arm again and pointed to the archway, shouting "Onward!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 116640]), Text sample: They were no longer marking time, they were marching; tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 191519]), Text sample: In that host were bearded men, old men, youths, fluttering robed bare armed women, girls.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72481]), Text sample: A monstrous black banner jerked its way to the right.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 219120]), Text sample: He perceived a blue clad negro, a shrivelled woman in yellow, then a group of tall fair haired, white faced, blue clad men pushed theatrically past him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33120]), Text sample: He noted two Chinamen.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 262320]), Text sample: A tall, sallow, dark haired, shining eyed youth, white clad from top to toe, clambered up towards the platform shouting loyally, and sprang down again and receded, looking backward.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 138719]), Text sample: Heads, shoulders, hands clutching weapons, all were swinging with those marching cadences.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 137280]), Text sample: Faces came out of the confusion to him as he stood there, eyes met his and passed and vanished.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 95760]), Text sample: Men gesticulated to him, shouted inaudible personal things.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68880]), Text sample: Most of the faces were flushed, but many were ghastly white.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 328082]), Text sample: Strange and incredible meeting! As the broad stream passed before him to the right, tributary gangways from the remote uplands of the hall thrust downward in an incessant replacement of people; tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 150000]), Text sample: Men and women mingled in the ranks; tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp. The whole world seemed marching.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90721]), Text sample: Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp; his brain was tramping.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 268801]), Text sample: Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp; at Lincoln's pressure he turned towards the archway, walking unconsciously in that rhythm, scarcely noticing his movement for the melody and stir of it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 218880]), Text sample: The multitude, the gesture and song, all moved in that direction, the flow of people smote downward until the upturned faces were below the level of his feet.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 172560]), Text sample: He was aware of a path before him, of a suite about him, of guards and dignities, and Lincoln on his right hand.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 103681]), Text sample: Attendants intervened, and ever and again blotted out the sight of the multitude to the left.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 73440]), Text sample: He did not know whither he went; he did not want to know.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74640]), Text sample: He glanced back across a flaming spaciousness of hall.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 27840]), Text sample: CHAPTER twenty one
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 180000]), Text sample: From the Business Quarter they presently passed by the running ways into a remote quarter of the city, where the bulk of the manufactures was done.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 182160]), Text sample: On their way the platforms crossed the Thames twice, and passed in a broad viaduct across one of the great roads that entered the city from the North.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 323040]), Text sample: In both cases his impression was swift and in both very vivid. The river was a broad wrinkled glitter of black sea water, overarched by buildings, and vanishing either way into a blackness starred with receding lights.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 96240]), Text sample: A string of black barges passed seaward, manned by blue clad men.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90000]), Text sample: Here, too, the distinctive blue of the Labour Department was in abundance.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 208800]), Text sample: One lank and very high carriage with longitudinal metallic rods hung with the dripping carcasses of many hundred sheep arrested his attention unduly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99600]), Text sample: Abruptly the edge of the archway cut and blotted out the picture.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 172080]), Text sample: Presently they left the way and descended by a lift and traversed a passage that sloped downward, and so came to a descending lift again.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 262560]), Text sample: Even the pretence of architectural ornament disappeared, the lights diminished in number and size, the architecture became more and more massive in proportion to the spaces as the factory quarters were reached.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 337440]), Text sample: And in the dusty biscuit making place of the potters, among the felspar mills, in the furnace rooms of the metal workers, among the incandescent lakes of crude Eadhamite, the blue canvas clothing was on man, woman and child.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 141600]), Text sample: The only people not in blue canvas were the overlookers of the work places and the orange clad Labour Police.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 279600]), Text sample: The burly labourers of the old Victorian times had followed that dray horse and all such living force producers, to extinction; the place of his costly muscles was taken by some dexterous machine.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 217200]), Text sample: The latter day labourer, male as well as female, was essentially a machine minder and feeder, a servant and attendant, or an artist under direction.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 146160]), Text sample: The women, in comparison with those Graham remembered, were as a class distinctly plain and flat chested.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 419280]), Text sample: To be brilliant physically or mentally, to be in any way attractive or exceptional, had been and was still a certain way of emancipation to the drudge, a line of escape to the Pleasure City and its splendours and delights, and at last to the Euthanasy and peace.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 150960]), Text sample: To be steadfast against such inducements was scarcely to be expected of meanly nourished souls.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 462720]), Text sample: In the young cities of Graham's former life, the newly aggregated labouring mass had been a diverse multitude, still stirred by the tradition of personal honour and a high morality; now it was differentiating into an instinct class, with a moral and physical difference of its own-even with a dialect of its own.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 345600]), Text sample: They penetrated downward, ever downward, towards the working places. Presently they passed underneath one of the streets of the moving ways, and saw its platforms running on their rails far overhead, and chinks of white lights between the transverse slits.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 325440]), Text sample: The factories that were not working were sparsely lighted; to Graham they and their shrouded aisles of giant machines seemed plunged in gloom, and even where work was going on the illumination was far less brilliant than upon the public ways.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 238800]), Text sample: They were high and dark, and rather cold. In the first a few men were making ornaments of gold filigree, each man at a little bench by himself, and with a little shaded light.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 279120]), Text sample: The long vista of light patches, with the nimble fingers brightly lit and moving among the gleaming yellow coils, and the intent face like the face of a ghost, in each shadow, had the oddest effect.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 146640]), Text sample: They assumed this on coming to work, but at night they were stripped and examined before they left the premises of the Department.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 149040]), Text sample: In spite of every precaution, the Labour policeman told them in a depressed tone, the Department was not infrequently robbed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 198240]), Text sample: "This is what I wanted to see," said Graham; "this is what I wanted to see," trying to avoid a start at a particularly striking disfigurement.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64320]), Text sample: "She might have done better with herself than that," said Asano.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48000]), Text sample: Graham made some indignant comments.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 125040]), Text sample: "But, Sire, we simply could not stand that stuff without the purple," said Asano.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 128160]), Text sample: "In your days people could stand such crudities, they were nearer the barbaric by two hundred years."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 162240]), Text sample: Looking over the parapet, Graham saw that beneath was a wharf under yet more tremendous archings than any he had seen.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 334320]), Text sample: Three barges, smothered in floury dust, were being unloaded of their cargoes of powdered felspar by a multitude of coughing men, each guiding a little truck; the dust filled the place with a choking mist, and turned the electric glare yellow.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 160800]), Text sample: The vague shadows of these workers gesticulated about their feet, and rushed to and fro against a long stretch of white washed wall.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47520]), Text sample: Every now and then one would stop to cough.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 317760]), Text sample: "Stop that!" shouted one of the policemen, but the order was disobeyed, and first one and then all the white stained men who were working there had taken up the beating refrain, singing it defiantly-the Song of the Revolt.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 115440]), Text sample: The feet upon the planks thundered now to the rhythm of the song, tramp, tramp, tramp.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53520]), Text sample: He made no further effort to stop the singing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 600960]), Text sample: That walk left on Graham's mind a maze of memories, fluctuating pictures of swathed halls, and crowded vaults seen through clouds of dust, of intricate machines, the racing threads of looms, the heavy beat of stamping machinery, the roar and rattle of belt and armature, of ill lit subterranean aisles of sleeping places, illimitable vistas of pin point lights.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 150240]), Text sample: Here was the smell of tanning, and here the reek of a brewery, and here unprecedented reeks.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 425760]), Text sample: Everywhere were pillars and cross archings of such a massiveness as Graham had never before seen, thick Titans of greasy, shining brickwork crushed beneath the vast weight of that complex city world, even as these anemic millions were crushed by its complexity.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43678]), Text sample: And then came a remote disorder.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 104399]), Text sample: But for the most part this remnant that worked, worked hopelessly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 117839]), Text sample: Then a woman with a face of mute white terror, and another who gasped and shrieked as she ran.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 120240]), Text sample: "What has happened now?" said Graham, puzzled, for he could not understand their thick speech.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58560]), Text sample: The Black Police are coming from South Africa....
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 19199]), Text sample: The Black Police.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 25919]), Text sample: The Black Police."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54000]), Text sample: "But how can they know?" asked Asano.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 27840]), Text sample: "Stop all work.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 345120]), Text sample: Stop all work," and a swarthy hunchback, ridiculously gay in green and gold, came leaping down the platforms toward him, bawling again and again in good English, "This is Ostrog's doing, Ostrog the Knave!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 180959]), Text sample: The Master is betrayed." His voice was hoarse and a thin foam dropped from his ugly shouting mouth.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 182160]), Text sample: He yelled an unspeakable horror that the Black Police had done in Paris, and so passed shrieking, "Ostrog the Knave!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 306960]), Text sample: He looked up at the great cliff of buildings on either side, vanishing into blue haze at last above the lights, and down to the roaring tiers of platforms, and the shouting, running people who were gesticulating past.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 36721]), Text sample: "The Master is betrayed!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82079]), Text sample: Suddenly the situation shaped itself in his mind real and urgent.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 38159]), Text sample: "It has come," he said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23759]), Text sample: "I might have known.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 26640]), Text sample: The hour has come."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 28080]), Text sample: He thought swiftly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 26401]), Text sample: "What am I to do?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45361]), Text sample: "Go back to the Council House," said Asano.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33118]), Text sample: "Why should I not appeal-?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 25680]), Text sample: The people are here."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 28080]), Text sample: "You will lose time.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 69121]), Text sample: But they will mass about the Council House.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47760]), Text sample: Your strength is there-with them."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42238]), Text sample: "It sounds true," said Asano.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 144960]), Text sample: And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it-oh so gently!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 271440]), Text sample: And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 76320]), Text sample: Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 143280]), Text sample: It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 212160]), Text sample: So you see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 101520]), Text sample: Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 123360]), Text sample: Never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers-of my sagacity.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60240]), Text sample: I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 197520]), Text sample: To think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48480]), Text sample: I kept quite still and said nothing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 180720]), Text sample: He was still sitting up in the bed listening;--just as I have done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147120]), Text sample: I say I knew it well. I knew what the old man felt, and pitied him, although I chuckled at heart.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 69840]), Text sample: His fears had been ever since growing upon him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 240720]), Text sample: And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel-although he neither saw nor heard-to feel the presence of my head within the room.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 123600]), Text sample: It was open-wide, wide open-and I grew furious as I gazed upon it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 417600]), Text sample: I saw it with perfect distinctness-all a dull blue, with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could see nothing else of the old man's face or person: for I had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43920]), Text sample: I knew that sound well, too.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 128160]), Text sample: It increased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57600]), Text sample: But even yet I refrained and kept still.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 77040]), Text sample: Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58320]), Text sample: The old man's terror must have been extreme!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 420480]), Text sample: It grew louder, I say, louder every moment!--do you mark me well I have told you that I am nervous: so I am. And now at the dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house, so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52800]), Text sample: But the beating grew louder, louder!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 38880]), Text sample: I thought the heart must burst.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 38640]), Text sample: The old man's hour had come!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48960]), Text sample: He shrieked once-once only.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78719]), Text sample: But, for many minutes, the heart beat on with a muffled sound.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 95280]), Text sample: This, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard through the wall.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 31921]), Text sample: At length it ceased.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32880]), Text sample: The old man was dead.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 55678]), Text sample: I removed the bed and examined the corpse.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57359]), Text sample: Yes, he was stone, stone dead.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 87840]), Text sample: I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 30719]), Text sample: There was no pulsation.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 28561]), Text sample: He was stone dead.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 182880]), Text sample: If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 81120]), Text sample: The night waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47519]), Text sample: First of all I dismembered the corpse.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 190080]), Text sample: I then replaced the boards so cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye-not even his-could have detected any thing wrong.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 118080]), Text sample: There was nothing to wash out-no stain of any kind-no blood spot whatever.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41039]), Text sample: I had been too wary for that.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 91199]), Text sample: As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 96000]), Text sample: I went down to open it with a light heart,--for what had I now to fear?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 330481]), Text sample: A shriek had been heard by a neighbour during the night; suspicion of foul play had been aroused; information had been lodged at the police office, and they (the officers) had been deputed to search the premises.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58798]), Text sample: I smiled,--for what had I to fear?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35280]), Text sample: I bade the gentlemen welcome.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 50161]), Text sample: I took my visitors all over the house.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51600]), Text sample: I led them, at length, to his chamber.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74880]), Text sample: I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39361]), Text sample: The officers were satisfied.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41520]), Text sample: I was singularly at ease.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 104880]), Text sample: They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they chatted of familiar things.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 94798]), Text sample: But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale and wished them gone.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 353279]), Text sample: The ringing became more distinct:--It continued and became more distinct: I talked more freely to get rid of the feeling: but it continued and gained definiteness-until, at length, I found that the noise was not within my ears.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74640]), Text sample: Yet the sound increased-and what could I do?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 150960]), Text sample: It was a low, dull, quick sound-much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 91199]), Text sample: I gasped for breath-and yet the officers heard it not.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 114000]), Text sample: I talked more quickly-more vehemently; but the noise steadily increased.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 190080]), Text sample: I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with violent gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37680]), Text sample: Why would they not be gone?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44880]), Text sample: Oh God! what could I do?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 59760]), Text sample: I foamed-I raved-I swore!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58081]), Text sample: It grew louder-louder-louder!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65279]), Text sample: And still the men chatted pleasantly, and smiled.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42480]), Text sample: Was it possible they heard not?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 70320]), Text sample: Almighty God!--no, no!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 188640]), Text sample: They heard!--they suspected!--they knew!--they were making a mockery of my horror!-this I thought, and this I think.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 126000]), Text sample: I felt that I must scream or die! and now-again!--hark! louder!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 17521]), Text sample: louder!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 17520]), Text sample: louder!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 18959]), Text sample: louder!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63839]), Text sample: I admit the deed!--tear up the planks!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34800]), Text sample: OF A MIRROR AND A BELL
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 158400]), Text sample: [Even to day, in the courts of certain Japanese temples, you may see heaps of old bronze mirrors contributed for such a purpose.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 290880]), Text sample: The largest collection of this kind that I ever saw was in the court of a temple of the Jodo sect, at Hakata, in Kyushu: the mirrors had been given for the making of a bronze statue of Amida, thirty three feet high.]
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 144480]), Text sample: Of course, if she could have offered the priests a certain sum of money in place of the mirror, she could have asked them to give back her heirloom.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41520]), Text sample: But she had not the money necessary.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 161520]), Text sample: Whenever she went to the temple, she saw her mirror lying in the court yard, behind a railing, among hundreds of other mirrors heaped there together.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 256560]), Text sample: She knew it by the Sho Chiku Bai in relief on the back of it,--those three fortunate emblems of Pine, Bamboo, and Plumflower, which delighted her baby eyes when her mother first showed her the mirror.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 110400]), Text sample: She longed for some chance to steal the mirror, and hide it,--that she might thereafter treasure it always.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 158160]), Text sample: But the chance did not come; and she became very unhappy,--felt as if she had foolishly given away a part of her life.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 59760]), Text sample: But she could not dare to speak of her pain to anybody.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 190080]), Text sample: Now, when all the mirrors contributed for the Mugenyama bell had been sent to the foundry, the bell founders discovered that there was one mirror among them which would not melt.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 84720]), Text sample: Again and again they tried to melt it; but it resisted all their efforts.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 96960]), Text sample: Evidently the woman who had given that mirror to the temple must have regretted the giving.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 213600]), Text sample: She had not presented her offering with all her heart; and therefore her selfish soul, remaining attached to the mirror, kept it hard and cold in the midst of the furnace.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 126720]), Text sample: Of course everybody heard of the matter, and everybody soon knew whose mirror it was that would not melt.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 143280]), Text sample: And because of this public exposure of her secret fault, the poor woman became very much ashamed and very angry.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 146640]), Text sample: And as she could not bear the shame, she drowned herself, after having written a farewell letter containing these words:--
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 116640]), Text sample: "When I am dead, it will not be difficult to melt the mirror and to cast the bell.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 124560]), Text sample: But, to the person who breaks that bell by ringing it, great wealth will be given by the ghost of me."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 174960]), Text sample: After the dead woman's mirror had been melted, and the bell had been successfully cast, people remembered the words of that letter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 213120]), Text sample: They felt sure that the spirit of the writer would give wealth to the breaker of the bell; and, as soon as the bell had been suspended in the court of the temple, they went in multitude to ring it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 236160]), Text sample: With all their might and main they swung the ringing beam; but the bell proved to be a good bell, and it bravely withstood their assaults. Nevertheless, the people were not easily discouraged.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 168480]), Text sample: Day after day, at all hours, they continued to ring the bell furiously,--caring nothing whatever for the protests of the priests.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 165120]), Text sample: So the ringing became an affliction; and the priests could not endure it; and they got rid of the bell by rolling it down the hill into a swamp.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 92400]), Text sample: The swamp was deep, and swallowed it up,--and that was the end of the bell.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 132480]), Text sample: Only its legend remains; and in that legend it is called the Mugen Kane, or Bell of Mugen.
