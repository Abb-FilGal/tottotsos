Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 132000]), Text sample: In fact, he had looked at twenty very much as he looked at sixty, lacking a little of the grayness.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35040]), Text sample: "It's a boy I've come for.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51360]), Text sample: Maybe they were out of boys of the brand you wanted."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 230880]), Text sample: Her face was small, white and thin, also much freckled; her mouth was large and so were her eyes, which looked green in some lights and moods and gray in others.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 127920]), Text sample: "I suppose you are mr matthew Cuthbert of Green Gables?" she said in a peculiarly clear, sweet voice.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56880]), Text sample: They were good, you know-the asylum people.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147840]), Text sample: With this Matthew's companion stopped talking, partly because she was out of breath and partly because they had reached the buggy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 141841]), Text sample: And I've never had a pretty dress in my life that I can remember-but of course it's all the more to look forward to, isn't it?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 59281]), Text sample: And then I can imagine that I'm dressed gorgeously.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 97920]), Text sample: When we got on the train I felt as if everybody must be looking at me and pitying me.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48238]), Text sample: I wasn't a bit sick coming over in the boat.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56882]), Text sample: She said she never saw the beat of me for prowling about.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47759]), Text sample: She said I must have asked her a thousand already.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39118]), Text sample: And what DOES make the roads red?"

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52560]), Text sample: "Well, that is one of the things to find out sometime.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89281]), Text sample: It just makes me feel glad to be alive-it's such an interesting world.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 28798]), Text sample: But am I talking too much?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33359]), Text sample: Would you rather I didn't talk?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 70800]), Text sample: I can STOP when I make up my mind to it, although it's difficult."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 88801]), Text sample: Women were bad enough in all conscience, but little girls were worse.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 21601]), Text sample: I don't mind."

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 142560]), Text sample: I can't feel exactly perfectly happy because-well, what color would you call this?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 61680]), Text sample: "Now you see why I can't be perfectly happy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23762]), Text sample: I never could find out.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20160]), Text sample: Can you tell me?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99600]), Text sample: "Well now, I'm afraid I can't," said matthew, who was getting a little dizzy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82560]), Text sample: "Well, whatever it was it must have been something nice because she was divinely beautiful.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67440]), Text sample: Have you ever imagined what it must feel like to be divinely beautiful?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 131040]), Text sample: Which would you rather be if you had the choice-divinely beautiful or dazzlingly clever or angelically good?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48959]), Text sample: It's certain I'll never be angelically good.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68640]), Text sample: mrs Spencer says-oh, mr Cuthbert!

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99841]), Text sample: They had simply rounded a curve in the road and found themselves in the "Avenue."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57840]), Text sample: Did you ever have an ache like that, mr Cuthbert?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90000]), Text sample: "Well now, I just can't recollect that I ever had."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 198241]), Text sample: Other people may call that place the Avenue, but I shall always call it the White Way of Delight. Have we really only another mile to go before we get home?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90721]), Text sample: Something still pleasanter may come after, but you can never be sure.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35760]), Text sample: But I'm glad to think of getting home.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51601]), Text sample: "That's Barry's pond," said matthew.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49681]), Text sample: But why do other people call it Barry's pond?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46799]), Text sample: Orchard Slope's the name of his place.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 26159]), Text sample: So I shut my eyes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 100081]), Text sample: Because, you see, if the bridge DID crumple up I'd want to SEE it crumple.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 40321]), Text sample: I always like the rumble part of it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24961]), Text sample: Now I'll look back.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 27841]), Text sample: I'm sure I'll guess right."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57601]), Text sample: "That's it, isn't it?" she said, pointing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 71282]), Text sample: But I reckon mrs Spencer described it so's you could tell."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45120]), Text sample: "No, she didn't-really she didn't.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 96478]), Text sample: All she said might just as well have been about most of those other places.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147600]), Text sample: Villefort's conduct, therefore, upon reflection, appeared to the baroness as if shaped for their mutual advantage.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 179760]), Text sample: She would invoke the past, recall old recollections; she would supplicate him by the remembrance of guilty, yet happy days.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57121]), Text sample: "Do you intend opening the door?" said the baroness.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 62160]), Text sample: "Who am I? You know me well enough."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41760]), Text sample: "Oh, this is too much!"

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 193919]), Text sample: She had not long to wait; directly afterwards the door was opened wide enough to admit her, and when she had passed through, it was again shut.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67678]), Text sample: "A mischance?" repeated the baroness.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 201839]), Text sample: "Your daughter will be married to morrow, if not to day-in a week, if not to morrow; and I do not think you can regret the intended husband of your daughter."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 105599]), Text sample: Come, forget him for a moment, and instead of pursuing him let him go."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 69600]), Text sample: "You are too late, madame; the orders are issued."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49681]), Text sample: "At least keep him there till my daughter be married."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 77039]), Text sample: "I was not thinking of that," replied Madame Danglars quickly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 267599]), Text sample: You could not help thinking of it, and saying to yourself, 'you, who pursue crime so vindictively, answer now, why are there unpunished crimes in your dwelling?'" The baroness became pale.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24000]), Text sample: "Well, I own it."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63120]), Text sample: "No one; his parents are unknown."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45358]), Text sample: What am I?--the law.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54958]), Text sample: Has the law any eyes to witness your grief?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63838]), Text sample: Has the law ears to be melted by your sweet voice?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 111120]), Text sample: You will tell me that I am a living being, and not a code-a man, and not a volume.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 25922]), Text sample: Have they loved me?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34319]), Text sample: Have they spared me?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74880]), Text sample: No, madame, they struck me, always struck me!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 206162]), Text sample: I have always found them; and more,--I repeat it with joy, with triumph,--I have always found some proof of human perversity or error.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 31682]), Text sample: "The weakness of a murderer!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44402]), Text sample: "His dishonor reflects upon us."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 87360]), Text sample: They went up by the stair, because they thought this would make a better impression.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 38400]), Text sample: Because, if so, we can go away."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51360]), Text sample: "I always cut their hair myself," said Wendy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74640]), Text sample: Then he burst into tears, and the truth came out.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64800]), Text sample: "I don't think he is a cypher," Tootles cried instantly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20880]), Text sample: "No, I don't.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20160]), Text sample: "Rather not.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39120]), Text sample: "Oh dear, are you going away?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 14880]), Text sample: "Yes."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 13680]), Text sample: "no"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33840]), Text sample: "About me, peter?"

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58800]), Text sample: "Would you send me to school?" he inquired craftily.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 16320]), Text sample: "Yes."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 31920]), Text sample: "And then to an office?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23520]), Text sample: "I suppose so."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32160]), Text sample: "I don't want to be a man.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 166560]), Text sample: "peter," said Wendy the comforter, "I should love you in a beard;" and mrs Darling stretched out her arms to him, but he repulsed her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 75840]), Text sample: "Keep back, lady, no one is going to catch me and make me a man."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 31680]), Text sample: "But where are you going to live?"

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24000]), Text sample: "I shall have Tink."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 96960]), Text sample: "Tink can't go a twentieth part of the way round," she reminded him a little tartly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 84720]), Text sample: "Sneaky tell tale!" Tink called out from somewhere round the corner.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37920]), Text sample: "It doesn't matter," peter said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39840]), Text sample: "O peter, you know it matters."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44640]), Text sample: "Well, then, come with me to the little house."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 25680]), Text sample: "Certainly not.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 194160]), Text sample: Wendy would have preferred a more permanent arrangement; and it seemed to her that spring would be long in coming; but this promise sent peter away quite gay again.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 108240]), Text sample: I suppose it was because Wendy knew this that her last words to him were these rather plaintive ones:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82800]), Text sample: "You won't forget me, peter, will you, before spring cleaning time comes?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52800]), Text sample: Of course peter promised; and then he flew away.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45600]), Text sample: He took mrs Darling's kiss with him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 87120]), Text sample: The kiss that had been for no one else, peter took quite easily.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 12960]), Text sample: Funny.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 30720]), Text sample: But she seemed satisfied.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 219120]), Text sample: Of course all the boys went to school; and most of them got into Class three, but Slightly was put first into Class four and then into Class five Class one is the top class.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58320]), Text sample: In time they could not even fly after their hats.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 116160]), Text sample: Want of practice, they called it; but what it really meant was that they no longer believed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 150720]), Text sample: Michael believed longer than the other boys, though they jeered at him; so he was with Wendy when peter came for her at the end of the first year.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66000]), Text sample: "I forget them after I kill them," he replied carelessly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 117600]), Text sample: When she expressed a doubtful hope that Tinker Bell would be glad to see her he said, "Who is Tinker Bell?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 111360]), Text sample: "O peter," she said, shocked; but even when she explained he could not remember.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37200]), Text sample: "There are such a lot of them," he said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 31920]), Text sample: "I expect she is no more."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 131280]), Text sample: I expect he was right, for fairies don't live long, but they are so little that a short time seems a good while to them.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 134400]), Text sample: But he was exactly as fascinating as ever, and they had a lovely spring cleaning in the little house on the tree tops.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43440]), Text sample: "Perhaps he is ill," Michael said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 241921]), Text sample: Michael came close to her and whispered, with a shiver, "Perhaps there is no such person, Wendy!" and then Wendy would have cried if Michael had not been crying.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 175199]), Text sample: For a little longer she tried for his sake not to have growing pains; and she felt she was untrue to him when she got a prize for general knowledge.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 257520]), Text sample: But the years came and went without bringing the careless boy; and when they met again Wendy was a married woman, and peter was no more to her than a little dust in the box in which she had kept her toys.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 28801]), Text sample: Wendy was grown up.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32640]), Text sample: You need not be sorry for her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42720]), Text sample: She was one of the kind that likes to grow up.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 88801]), Text sample: In the end she grew up of her own free will a day quicker than other girls.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 127440]), Text sample: All the boys were grown up and done for by this time; so it is scarcely worth while saying anything more about them.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 128159]), Text sample: You may see the twins and Nibs and Curly any day going to an office, each carrying a little bag and an umbrella.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58320]), Text sample: You see that judge in a wig coming out at the iron door?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 30480]), Text sample: That used to be Tootles.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 107759]), Text sample: The bearded man who doesn't know any story to tell his children was once john.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82080]), Text sample: When she was old enough to ask them they were mostly about peter Pan.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 158159]), Text sample: She loved to hear of peter, and Wendy told her all she could remember in the very nursery from which the famous flight had taken place.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 144479]), Text sample: There were only two beds in the nursery now, Jane's and her nurse's; and there was no kennel, for Nana also had passed away.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 189600]), Text sample: She died of old age, and at the end she had been rather difficult to get on with; being very firmly convinced that no one knew how to look after children except herself.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 110880]), Text sample: Once a week Jane's nurse had her evening off; and then it was Wendy's part to put Jane to bed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43199]), Text sample: That was the time for stories.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 144960]), Text sample: "I don't think I see anything to night," says Wendy, with a feeling that if Nana were here she would object to further conversation.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 55440]), Text sample: "That is a long time ago, sweetheart," says Wendy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 29040]), Text sample: "Yes, you did."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45839]), Text sample: "The dear old days when I could fly!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37440]), Text sample: "Why can't you fly now, mother?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42241]), Text sample: When people grow up they forget the way."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33359]), Text sample: "Why do they forget the way?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72240]), Text sample: It is only the gay and innocent and heartless who can fly."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48238]), Text sample: "What is gay and innocent and heartless?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52560]), Text sample: Or perhaps Wendy admits she does see something.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54000]), Text sample: "I do believe it is," says Jane.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 180959]), Text sample: "The foolish fellow," says Wendy, "tried to stick it on with soap, and when he could not he cried, and that woke me, and I sewed it on for him."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 102240]), Text sample: "You have missed a bit," interrupts Jane, who now knows the story better than her mother.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90000]), Text sample: "I sat up in bed and I said, 'Boy, why are you crying?'"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 84961]), Text sample: "Yes, that was it," says Jane, with a big breath.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 55199]), Text sample: "Yes! which did you like best of all?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56401]), Text sample: "I think I liked the home under the ground best of all."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 91681]), Text sample: "Yes, so do i What was the last thing peter ever said to you?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 160560]), Text sample: "The last thing he ever said to me was, 'Just always be waiting for me, and then some night you will hear me crowing.'"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 17521]), Text sample: "Yes."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 124560]), Text sample: "But, alas, he forgot all about me," Wendy said it with a smile.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34800]), Text sample: She was as grown up as that.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68399]), Text sample: "What did his crow sound like?" Jane asked one evening.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 30240]), Text sample: Wendy was a little startled.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34080]), Text sample: "My darling, how can you know?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45600]), Text sample: And then one night came the tragedy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 212401]), Text sample: Wendy was sitting on the floor, very close to the fire, so as to see to darn, for there was no other light in the nursery; and while she sat darning she heard a crow.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 113281]), Text sample: He was exactly the same as ever, and Wendy saw at once that he still had all his first teeth.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52560]), Text sample: He was a little boy, and she was grown up.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 124322]), Text sample: She huddled by the fire not daring to move, helpless and guilty, a big woman.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 95039]), Text sample: Something inside her was crying "Woman, Woman, let go of me."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 79200]), Text sample: "That is not Michael," she said quickly, lest a judgment should fall on her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 15118]), Text sample: "Yes."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 19680]), Text sample: "Boy or girl?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 12240]), Text sample: "Girl."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51840]), Text sample: Now surely he would understand; but not a bit of it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 157921]), Text sample: "Of course; that is why I have come." He added a little sternly, "Have you forgotten that this is spring cleaning time?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33839]), Text sample: "What is it?" he cried, shrinking.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57359]), Text sample: Then she turned up the light, and peter saw.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 154560]), Text sample: He gave a cry of pain; and when the tall beautiful creature stooped to lift him in her arms he drew back sharply.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33121]), Text sample: "What is it?" he cried again.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45361]), Text sample: I am ever so much more than twenty.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 31679]), Text sample: I grew up long ago."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32400]), Text sample: "You promised not to!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 26162]), Text sample: "I couldn't help it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 19201]), Text sample: "No, you're not."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52802]), Text sample: "Yes, and the little girl in the bed is my baby."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 22802]), Text sample: "No, she's not."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32880]), Text sample: Of course he did not strike.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82561]), Text sample: peter continued to cry, and soon his sobs woke Jane.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56642]), Text sample: She sat up in bed, and was interested at once.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 76799]), Text sample: peter rose and bowed to her, and she bowed to him from the bed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64081]), Text sample: "My name is peter Pan," he told her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20162]), Text sample: "Yes, I know."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66721]), Text sample: "Yes, I know," Jane said, "I have been waiting for you."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 217922]), Text sample: When Wendy returned diffidently she found peter sitting on the bed post crowing gloriously, while Jane in her nighty was flying round the room in solemn ecstasy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51841]), Text sample: "He does so need a mother," Jane said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 28561]), Text sample: Wendy rushed to the window.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45601]), Text sample: "No, no," she cried.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 131282]), Text sample: "It is just for spring cleaning time," Jane said, "he wants me always to do his spring cleaning."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 341522]), Text sample: Jane is now a common grown up, with a daughter called Margaret; and every spring cleaning time, except when he forgets, peter comes for Margaret and takes her to the Neverland, where she tells him stories about himself, to which he listens eagerly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33600]), Text sample: CHAPTER eleven
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 348720]), Text sample: He carried out his resolve with a great deal of tact, and the young lady found in renewed contact with him no obstacle to the exercise of her genius for unshrinking enquiry, the general application of her confidence.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 287760]), Text sample: I don't like Miss Stackpole-everything about her displeases me; she talks so much too loud and looks at one as if one wanted to look at her-which one doesn't.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 100080]), Text sample: She'd like Gardencourt a great deal better if it were a boarding house.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66240]), Text sample: For me, I find it almost too much of one!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 103920]), Text sample: We shall never get on together therefore, and there's no use trying."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 133920]), Text sample: This contribution to the discussion, however, Miss Stackpole rejected with scorn.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39120]), Text sample: Middling indeed!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 152640]), Text sample: If they were not the best in the world they were the worst, but there was nothing middling about an American hotel.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74400]), Text sample: "I don't know what you mean," Henrietta replied.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60960]), Text sample: "I like to be treated as an American lady."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99600]), Text sample: "They're the companions of freemen," Henrietta retorted.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 135360]), Text sample: "They're the companions of their servants-the Irish chambermaid and the negro waiter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34080]), Text sample: They share their work."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 159120]), Text sample: "Do you call the domestics in an American household 'slaves'?" Miss Stackpole enquired.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 101520]), Text sample: "If that's the way you desire to treat them, no wonder you don't like America."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 125040]), Text sample: "They're very bad in America, but I've five perfect ones in Florence."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 112080]), Text sample: "Should you like me better if I were your butler, dear?" her husband asked.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 87120]), Text sample: "I don't think I should: you wouldn't at all have the tenue."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 170400]), Text sample: "The companions of freemen-I like that, Miss Stackpole," said Ralph. "It's a beautiful description."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 79680]), Text sample: And this was the only reward that Ralph got for his compliment.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 293040]), Text sample: It was perhaps because her mind was oppressed with this image that she suffered some days to elapse before she took occasion to say to Isabel: "My dear friend, I wonder if you're growing faithless."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 21360]), Text sample: "Faithless?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51840]), Text sample: Faithless to you, Henrietta?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82800]), Text sample: "No, that would be a great pain; but it's not that."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43440]), Text sample: "Faithless to my country then?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57120]), Text sample: "Ah, that I hope will never be.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47520]), Text sample: You've never asked me what it is.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42960]), Text sample: Is it because you've suspected?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 28800]), Text sample: "Suspected what?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68400]), Text sample: As a rule I don't think I suspect," said Isabel.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 111360]), Text sample: "I remember now that phrase in your letter, but I confess I had forgotten it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35040]), Text sample: What have you to tell me?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 186720]), Text sample: Henrietta looked disappointed, and her steady gaze betrayed it. "You don't ask that right-as if you thought it important.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 77760]), Text sample: You're changed-you're thinking of other things."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64080]), Text sample: "Tell me what you mean, and I'll think of that."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35520]), Text sample: "Will you really think of it?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43920]), Text sample: That's what I wish to be sure of."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 115920]), Text sample: "I've not much control of my thoughts, but I'll do my best," said Isabel.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 261840]), Text sample: Henrietta gazed at her, in silence, for a period which tried Isabel's patience, so that our heroine added at last: "Do you mean that you're going to be married?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 81120]), Text sample: "Not till I've seen Europe!" said Miss Stackpole.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 100561]), Text sample: "What I mean is that mr Goodwood came out in the steamer with me."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51359]), Text sample: "Ah!" Isabel responded.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33601]), Text sample: "You say that right.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 81121]), Text sample: I had a good deal of talk with him; he has come after you."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37681]), Text sample: "Did he tell you so?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 246000]), Text sample: "No, he told me nothing; that's how I knew it," said Henrietta cleverly. "He said very little about you, but I spoke of you a good deal."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 26640]), Text sample: Isabel waited.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 96959]), Text sample: At the mention of mr Goodwood's name she had turned a little pale.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82079]), Text sample: "I'm very sorry you did that," she observed at last.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 161520]), Text sample: I could have talked a long time to such a listener; he was so quiet, so intense; he drank it all in."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66719]), Text sample: "What did you say about me?" Isabel asked.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72719]), Text sample: "I said you were on the whole the finest creature I know."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 118080]), Text sample: I see his face now, and his earnest absorbed look while I talked.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64800]), Text sample: I never saw an ugly man look so handsome."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99840]), Text sample: "It's not a grand passion; I'm very sure it's not that."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 70560]), Text sample: "I shall say it better to mr Goodwood himself."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 139680]), Text sample: Isabel offered no answer to this assertion, which her companion made with an air of great confidence.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65519]), Text sample: "He'll find you changed," the latter pursued.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24961]), Text sample: "Very likely.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 40801]), Text sample: I'm affected by everything."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 144719]), Text sample: Isabel failed even to smile back and in a moment she said: "Did he ask you to speak to me?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 118798]), Text sample: But his eyes asked it-and his handshake, when he bade me good bye."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 71762]), Text sample: "Thank you for doing so." And Isabel turned away.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 120959]), Text sample: "Yes, you're changed; you've got new ideas over here," her friend continued.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 120240]), Text sample: "I hope so," said Isabel; "one should get as many new ideas as possible."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 123118]), Text sample: "Yes; but they shouldn't interfere with the old ones when the old ones have been the right ones."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47039]), Text sample: Isabel turned about again.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 174000]), Text sample: "If you mean that I had any idea with regard to mr Goodwood-!" But she faltered before her friend's implacable glitter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 79680]), Text sample: "My dear child, you certainly encouraged him."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 190319]), Text sample: Isabel made for the moment as if to deny this charge; instead of which, however, she presently answered: "It's very true.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 164640]), Text sample: I did encourage him." And then she asked if her companion had learned from mr Goodwood what he intended to do.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 106800]), Text sample: "I asked him, and he said he meant to do nothing," Miss Stackpole answered.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 87601]), Text sample: "But I don't believe that; he's not a man to do nothing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 59521]), Text sample: He is a man of high, bold action.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 198961]), Text sample: "I quite believe that." Henrietta might be wanting in delicacy, but it touched the girl, all the same, to hear this declaration.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 87841]), Text sample: "Ah, you do care for him!" her visitor rang out.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 84000]), Text sample: "Whatever he does will always be right," Isabel repeated.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 134880]), Text sample: "When a man's of that infallible mould what does it matter to him what one feels?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 85440]), Text sample: "It may not matter to him, but it matters to one's self."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 143281]), Text sample: "Ah, what it matters to me-that's not what we're discussing," said Isabel with a cold smile.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47521]), Text sample: This time her companion was grave.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58560]), Text sample: "Well, I don't care; you have changed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 119759]), Text sample: You're not the girl you were a few short weeks ago, and mr Goodwood will see it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48000]), Text sample: I expect him here any day."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68399]), Text sample: "I hope he'll hate me then," said Isabel.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 91202]), Text sample: "I believe you hope it about as much as I believe him capable of it."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 195600]), Text sample: She pretended to herself, however, that she thought the event impossible, and, later, she communicated her disbelief to her friend.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 354480]), Text sample: The feeling pressed upon her; it made the air sultry, as if there were to be a change of weather; and the weather, socially speaking, had been so agreeable during Isabel's stay at Gardencourt that any change would be for the worse.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 85199]), Text sample: Her suspense indeed was dissipated the second day.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 428159]), Text sample: She entertained herself for some moments with talking to the little terrier, as to whom the proposal of an ownership divided with her cousin had been applied as impartially as possible-as impartially as Bunchie's own somewhat fickle and inconstant sympathies would allow.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 257280]), Text sample: But she was notified for the first time, on this occasion, of the finite character of Bunchie's intellect; hitherto she had been mainly struck with its extent.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 343681]), Text sample: It seemed to her at last that she would do well to take a book; formerly, when heavy hearted, she had been able, with the help of some well chosen volume, to transfer the seat of consciousness to the organ of pure reason.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 512880]), Text sample: Of late, it was not to be denied, literature had seemed a fading light, and even after she had reminded herself that her uncle's library was provided with a complete set of those authors which no gentleman's collection should be without, she sat motionless and empty handed, her eyes bent on the cool green turf of the lawn.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 133919]), Text sample: Her meditations were presently interrupted by the arrival of a servant who handed her a letter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 289681]), Text sample: The letter bore the London postmark and was addressed in a hand she knew-that came into her vision, already so held by him, with the vividness of the writer's voice or his face.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 97200]), Text sample: This document proved short and may be given entire.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 227279]), Text sample: MY DEAR MISS ARCHER-I don't know whether you will have heard of my coming to England, but even if you have not it will scarcely be a surprise to you.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 199440]), Text sample: I protested against it. You in fact appeared to accept my protest and to admit that I had the right on my side.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 251519]), Text sample: I had come to see you with the hope that you would let me bring you over to my conviction; my reasons for entertaining this hope had been of the best.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 212161]), Text sample: You admitted that you were unreasonable, and it was the only concession you would make; but it was a very cheap one, because that's not your character.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 128161]), Text sample: No, you are not, and you never will be, arbitrary or capricious.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 141841]), Text sample: You told me that I'm not disagreeable to you, and I believe it; for I don't see why that should be.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 111358]), Text sample: If I like this country at present it is only because it holds you.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 86880]), Text sample: I have been to England before, but have never enjoyed it much.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 199680]), Text sample: "I hope that we shall both forget this unhappy morning and that you will give me an opportunity of rendering to you in person, the apologies which are due to you.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 177120]), Text sample: I feel that anything less will neither rehabilitate me in your esteem, nor secure for me the remnants of my shattered self respect.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 308640]), Text sample: "I am hoping you will dine with me next week and meet a most interesting man, George Gathercole, who has just returned from Patagonia,--I only received his letter this morning- having made most remarkable discoveries concerning that country.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 254880]), Text sample: "I feel sure that you are large enough minded and too much a man of the world to allow my foolish fit of temper to disturb a relationship which I have always hoped would be mutually pleasant.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 301680]), Text sample: If you will allow Gathercole, who will be unconscious of the part he is playing, to act as peacemaker between yourself and myself, I shall feel that his trip, which has cost me a large sum of money, will not have been wasted.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49440]), Text sample: "I am, dear mr Meredith,
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 29040]), Text sample: "REMINGTON KARA."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68640]), Text sample: Kara folded the letter and inserted it in its envelope.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 148800]), Text sample: He rang a bell on his table and the girl who had so filled t x with a sense of awe came from an adjoining room.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52800]), Text sample: "You will see that this is delivered, Miss Holland."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68160]), Text sample: Kara rose from his desk and began to pace the room.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67200]), Text sample: "Do you know t x Meredith?" he asked suddenly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 40560]), Text sample: "I have heard of him," said the girl.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 148800]), Text sample: "A man with a singular mind," said Kara; "a man against whom my favourite weapon would fail."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51840]), Text sample: She looked at him with interest in her eyes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 75120]), Text sample: "What is your favourite weapon, mr Kara?" she asked.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 159600]), Text sample: Probably he required no such encouragement, for in the presence of his social inferiors he was somewhat monopolizing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57120]), Text sample: "Cut a man's flesh and it heals," he said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 141360]), Text sample: Fear is a tyrant and a despot, more terrible than the rack, more potent than the stake.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60240]), Text sample: "Is that your creed?" she asked quietly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48960]), Text sample: "Part of it, Miss Holland," he smiled.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 146160]), Text sample: She played idly with the letter she held in her hand, balancing it on the edge of the desk, her eyes downcast.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 83280]), Text sample: "What would justify the use of such an awful weapon?" she asked.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 79200]), Text sample: "It is amply justified to secure an end," he said blandly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 179280]), Text sample: "For example-I want something-I cannot obtain that something through the ordinary channel or by the employment of ordinary means.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44640]), Text sample: If I can buy it, well and good.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 114480]), Text sample: If I can buy those who can use their influence to secure this thing for me, so much the better.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 213360]), Text sample: If I can obtain it by any merit I possess, I utilize that merit, providing always, that I can secure my object in the time, otherwise-"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32400]), Text sample: He shrugged his shoulders.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64800]), Text sample: "I see," she said, nodding her head quickly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54480]), Text sample: "I suppose that is how blackmailers feel."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 97440]), Text sample: "That is a word I never use, nor do I like to hear it employed," he said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89040]), Text sample: "Blackmail suggests to me a vulgar attempt to obtain money."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 213120]), Text sample: "Which is generally very badly wanted by the people who use it," said the girl, with a little smile, "and, according to your argument, they are also justified."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58320]), Text sample: "It is a matter of plane," he said airily.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 186240]), Text sample: "Viewed from my standpoint, they are sordid criminals-the sort of person that t x meets, I presume, in the course of his daily work.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 143760]), Text sample: t x," he went on somewhat oracularly, "is a man for whom I have a great deal of respect.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 132720]), Text sample: You will probably meet him again, for he will find an opportunity of asking you a few questions about myself.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 38880]), Text sample: I need hardly tell you-"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60000]), Text sample: He lifted his shoulders with a deprecating smile.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99600]), Text sample: "I shall certainly not discuss your business with any person," said the girl coldly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 73680]), Text sample: "I am paying you three pounds a week, I think," he said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 104880]), Text sample: "I intend increasing that to five pounds because you suit me most admirably."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 116880]), Text sample: "Thank you," said the girl quietly, "but I am already being paid quite sufficient."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 92640]), Text sample: She left him, a little astonished and not a little ruffled.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 129840]), Text sample: To refuse the favours of Remington Kara was, by him, regarded as something of an affront.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 213360]), Text sample: Half his quarrel with t x was that gentleman's curious indifference to the benevolent attitude which Kara had persistently adopted in his dealings with the detective.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66480]), Text sample: He rang the bell, this time for his valet.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 328320]), Text sample: "Fisher," he said, "I am expecting a visit from a gentleman named Gathercole-a one armed gentleman whom you must look after if he comes. Detain him on some pretext or other because he is rather difficult to get hold of and I want to see him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 69360]), Text sample: Do whatever you can to prevent him going away until I return.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74400]), Text sample: He will probably be interested if you take him into the library."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 102240]), Text sample: "Very good, sir," said the urbane Fisher, "will you change before you go out?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 27840]), Text sample: Kara shook his head.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48000]), Text sample: "I think I will go as I am," he said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 28560]), Text sample: "Get me my fur coat.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 117600]), Text sample: This beastly cold kills me," he shivered as he glanced into the bleak street.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 120960]), Text sample: "Keep my fire going, put all my private letters in my bedroom, and see that Miss Holland has her lunch."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 164160]), Text sample: Fisher followed him to his car, wrapped the fur rug about his legs, closed the door carefully and returned to the house.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 102000]), Text sample: From thence onward his behaviour was somewhat extraordinary for a well bred servant.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 107760]), Text sample: That he should return to Kara's study and set the papers in order was natural and proper.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 81600]), Text sample: Kara was given to making friends of his servants-up to a point.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 232080]), Text sample: In his more generous moments he would address his bodyguard as "Fred," and on more occasions than one, and for no apparent reason, had tipped his servant over and above his salary.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 270720]), Text sample: mr Fred Fisher found little to reward him for his search until he came upon Kara's cheque book which told him that on the previous day the Greek had drawn six thousand pounds in cash from the bank.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 166800]), Text sample: This interested him mightily and he replaced the cheque book with the tightened lips and the fixed gaze of a man who was thinking rapidly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 293760]), Text sample: He paid a visit to the library, where the secretary was engaged in making copies of Kara's correspondence, answering letters appealing for charitable donations, and in the hack words which fall to the secretaries of the great.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 140400]), Text sample: He replenished the fire, asked deferentially for any instructions and returned again to his quest.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 76080]), Text sample: This time he made the bedroom the scene of his investigations.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48480]), Text sample: This however yielded no result.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 160320]), Text sample: By the side of the bed on a small table was a telephone, the sight of which apparently afforded the servant a little amusement.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43680]), Text sample: "Rum cove," said Fisher.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 248880]), Text sample: He paused for a moment before the closed door of the room and smilingly surveyed the great steel latch which spanned the door and fitted into an iron socket securely screwed to the framework.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 200880]), Text sample: He lifted it gingerly-there was a little knob for the purpose-and let it fall gently into the socket which had been made to receive it on the door itself.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 186000]), Text sample: "Rum cove," he said again, and lifting the latch to the hook which held it up, left the room, closing the door softly behind him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 127921]), Text sample: He walked down the corridor, with a meditative frown, and began to descend the stairs to the hall.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 109681]), Text sample: He was less than half-way down when the one maid of Kara's household came up to meet him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 93360]), Text sample: "There's a gentleman who wants to see mr Kara," she said, "here is his card."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 73199]), Text sample: Fisher took the card from the salver and read, "mr
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60960]), Text sample: George Gathercole, Junior Travellers' Club."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74880]), Text sample: "I'll see this gentleman," he said, with a sudden brisk interest.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 157199]), Text sample: He was a man who would have attracted attention, if only from the somewhat eccentric nature of his dress and his unkempt appearance.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 282000]), Text sample: He was dressed in a well worn overcoat of a somewhat pronounced check, he had a top hat, glossy and obviously new, at the back of his head, and the lower part of his face was covered by a ragged beard.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 237121]), Text sample: This he was plucking with nervous jerks, talking to himself the while, and casting a disparaging eye upon the portrait of Remington Kara which hung above the marble fireplace.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 150481]), Text sample: A pair of pince nez sat crookedly on his nose and two fat volumes under his arm completed the picture.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 215040]), Text sample: Fisher, who was an observer of some discernment, noticed under the overcoat a creased blue suit, large black boots and a pair of pearl studs.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47760]), Text sample: The newcomer glared round at the valet.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 86639]), Text sample: "Take these!" he ordered peremptorily, pointing to the books under his arm.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 176880]), Text sample: Accidentally the valet's hand pressed against the other's sleeve and he received a shock, for the forearm was clearly an artificial one.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 316560]), Text sample: It was against a wooden surface beneath the sleeve that his knuckles struck, and this view of the stranger's infirmity was confirmed when the other reached round with his right hand, took hold of the gloved left hand and thrust it into the pocket of his overcoat.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52079]), Text sample: "Where is Kara?" growled the stranger.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 75601]), Text sample: "He will be back very shortly, sir," said the urbane Fisher.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46080]), Text sample: "Out, is he?" boomed the visitor.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32161]), Text sample: "Then I shan't wait.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47279]), Text sample: What the devil does he mean by being out?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48480]), Text sample: He's had three years to be out!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48481]), Text sample: "mr Kara expects you, sir.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 69120]), Text sample: He told me he would be in at six o'clock at the latest."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57601]), Text sample: "What dog am I that I should wait till six?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51120]), Text sample: He gave a savage little tug at his beard.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 26880]), Text sample: "Six o'clock, eh?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49199]), Text sample: You will tell mr Kara that I called.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 26400]), Text sample: Give me those books."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 55680]), Text sample: "But I assure you, sir,--" stammered Fisher.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 55202]), Text sample: "Give me those books!" roared the other.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 270480]), Text sample: Deftly he lifted his left hand from the pocket, crooked the elbow by some quick manipulation, and thrust the books, which the valet most reluctantly handed to him, back to the place from whence he had taken them.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 21840]), Text sample: Good morning to you."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72481]), Text sample: "If you would only wait, sir," pleaded the agonized Fisher.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48959]), Text sample: "I've waited three years, I tell you.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64080]), Text sample: Tell mr Kara to expect me when he sees me!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45120]), Text sample: Fisher went back to the library.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74880]), Text sample: The girl was sealing up some letters as he entered and looked up.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 91921]), Text sample: "I am afraid, Miss Holland, I've got myself into very serious trouble."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48240]), Text sample: "What is that, Fisher!" asked the girl.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 117120]), Text sample: "There was a gentleman coming to see mr Kara, whom mr Kara particularly wanted to see."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46560]), Text sample: "mr Gathercole," said the girl quickly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20401]), Text sample: Fisher nodded.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51121]), Text sample: "Yes, miss, I couldn't get him to stay though."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 40801]), Text sample: She pursed her lips thoughtfully.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90238]), Text sample: "mr Kara will be very cross, but I don't see how you can help it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35520]), Text sample: I wish you had called me."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 141601]), Text sample: "He never gave a chance, miss," said Fisher, with a little smile, "but if he comes again I'll show him straight up to you."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 19200]), Text sample: She nodded.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78960]), Text sample: "Is there anything you want, miss?" he asked as he stood at the door.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 59280]), Text sample: "What time did mr Kara say he would be back?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53519]), Text sample: "At six o'clock, miss," the man replied.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39840]), Text sample: "Shall I ring up for a messenger?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56640]), Text sample: "No, I don't think that would be advisable.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35280]), Text sample: You had better take it yourself."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47520]), Text sample: "I will go with pleasure, miss," he said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 264721]), Text sample: He put it carefully in his pocket and went from the room to change. Large as the house was Kara did not employ a regular staff of servants. A maid and a valet comprised the whole of the indoor staff.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147361]), Text sample: His cook, and the other domestics, necessary for conducting an establishment of that size, were engaged by the day.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 294961]), Text sample: Kara had returned from the country earlier than had been anticipated, and, save for Fisher, the only other person in the house beside the girl, was the middle aged domestic who was parlour maid, serving maid and housekeeper in one.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 176880]), Text sample: She heard the soft thud of the front door closing, and rising she crossed the room rapidly and looked down through the window to the street.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 213599]), Text sample: It was not the first visit she had made to the big underground room with its vaulted roof and its great ranges-which were seldom used nowadays, for Kara gave no dinners.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 77279]), Text sample: The maid-who was also cook-arose up as the girl entered.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 94560]), Text sample: "It's a sight for sore eyes to see you in my kitchen, miss," she smiled.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 84959]), Text sample: "I'm afraid you're rather lonely, mrs Beale," said the girl sympathetically.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47041]), Text sample: It's that door that gives me the hump."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 108000]), Text sample: She pointed to the far end of the kitchen to a soiled looking door of unpainted wood.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 106319]), Text sample: I know he goes in sometimes because I tried a dodge that my brother-who's a policeman-taught me.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 131280]), Text sample: "mr Kara keeps some of his private papers in there," said the girl quietly, "he has told me so himself."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33118]), Text sample: Miss Holland laughed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 73202]), Text sample: "I want you to go out now," she said, "I have no stamps."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 252959]), Text sample: mrs Beale obeyed with alacrity and whilst she was assuming a hat-being desirous of maintaining her prestige as housekeeper in the eyes of Cadogan Square, the girl ascended to the upper floor.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 70320]), Text sample: Again she watched from the window the disappearing figure.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 71760]), Text sample: From her bag she produced a small purse and opened it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56400]), Text sample: In that case was a new steel key.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 100800]), Text sample: She passed swiftly down the corridor to Kara's room and made straight for the safe.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89520]), Text sample: In two seconds it was open and she was examining its contents.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54960]), Text sample: It was a large safe of the usual type.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 100801]), Text sample: There were four steel drawers fitted at the back and at the bottom of the strong box.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39839]), Text sample: The top pair were locked.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 111600]), Text sample: She was prepared for this contingency and a second key was as efficacious as the first.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 93360]), Text sample: An examination of the first drawer did not produce all that she had expected.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 91200]), Text sample: She returned the papers to the drawer, pushed it to and locked it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53041]), Text sample: She gave her attention to the second drawer.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 50640]), Text sample: Her hand shook a little as she pulled it open.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 61680]), Text sample: It was her last chance, her last hope.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 83760]), Text sample: There were a number of small jewel boxes almost filling the drawer.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 181202]), Text sample: She took them out one by one and at the bottom she found what she had been searching for and that which had filled her thoughts for the past three months.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 69599]), Text sample: It was a square case covered in red morocco leather.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 25440]), Text sample: CHAPTER twelve
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 123360]), Text sample: What started the train of thought he did not know, but at that moment his mind was very far away.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 110640]), Text sample: He remembered the day well because it was Candlemas day, and this was the anniversary.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49440]), Text sample: He remembered other things more pleasant.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 158880]), Text sample: The beat of hoofs on the rocky roadway, the crash of the door falling in when the Turkish Gendarmes had battered a way to his rescue.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 244560]), Text sample: He remembered with a savage joy the spectacle of his would be assassins twitching and struggling on the gallows at Pezara and-he heard the faint tinkle of the front door bell.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37440]), Text sample: Had t x returned!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 96720]), Text sample: He slipped from the bed and went to the door, opened it slightly and listened.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 159360]), Text sample: t x with a search warrant might be a source of panic especially if-he shrugged his shoulders.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63600]), Text sample: He had satisfied t x and allayed his suspicions.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65760]), Text sample: He would get Fisher out of the way that night and make sure.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 59040]), Text sample: The voice from the hall below was loud and gruff.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24480]), Text sample: Who could it be!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42240]), Text sample: "Will you see mr Gathercole now!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 26640]), Text sample: "mr Gathercole!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 92400]), Text sample: Kara breathed a sigh of relief and his face was wreathed in smiles.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24480]), Text sample: Tell him to come up.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 50640]), Text sample: Ask him if he minds seeing me in my room."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 21120]), Text sample: Kara laughed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 105600]), Text sample: "Send him up," he said, and then as Fisher was going out of the room he called him back.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 92880]), Text sample: "By the way, Fisher, after mr Gathercole has gone, you may go out for the night.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 88320]), Text sample: You've got somewhere to go, I suppose, and you needn't come back until the morning."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37680]), Text sample: "Yes, sir," said the servant.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63840]), Text sample: Such an instruction was remarkably pleasing to him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 96960]), Text sample: There was much that he had to do and that night's freedom would assist him materially.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 114480]), Text sample: "Perhaps" Kara hesitated, "perhaps you had better wait until eleven o'clock.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67680]), Text sample: Bring me up some sandwiches and a large glass of milk.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 61920]), Text sample: Or better still, place them on a plate in the hall."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54240]), Text sample: "Very good, sir," said the man and withdrew.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51600]), Text sample: "mr Kara will see you, sir," said Fisher.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 114720]), Text sample: "Oh!" said the other glaring at the unoffending Fisher, "that's very good of him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 133440]), Text sample: Very good of this person to see a scholar and a gentleman who has been about his dirty business for three years.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41040]), Text sample: Grown grey in his service!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 38160]), Text sample: Do you understand that, my man!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39600]), Text sample: "Yes, sir," said Fisher.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 16560]), Text sample: "Look here!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 40320]), Text sample: The man thrust out his face.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54000]), Text sample: "Do you see those grey hairs in my beard?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48000]), Text sample: The embarrassed Fisher grinned.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64560]), Text sample: "Is it grey!" challenged the visitor, with a roar.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54240]), Text sample: "Yes, sir," said the valet hastily.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57360]), Text sample: "Is it real grey?" insisted the visitor.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32400]), Text sample: "Pull one out and see!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72480]), Text sample: The startled Fisher drew back with an apologetic smile.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58320]), Text sample: "I couldn't think of doing a thing like that, sir."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78240]), Text sample: "Oh, you couldn't," sneered the visitor; "then lead on!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44160]), Text sample: Fisher showed the way up the stairs.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57600]), Text sample: This time the traveller carried no books.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 193200]), Text sample: His left arm hung limply by his side and Fisher privately gathered that the hand had got loose from the detaining pocket without its owner being aware of the fact.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57360]), Text sample: He pushed open the door and announced, "mr
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 265200]), Text sample: Gathercole," and Kara came forward with a smile to meet his agent, who, with top hat still on the top of his head, and his overcoat dangling about his heels, must have made a remarkable picture.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89760]), Text sample: Fisher closed the door behind them and returned to his duties in the hall below.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 109200]), Text sample: Ten minutes later he heard the door opened and the booming voice of the stranger came down to him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 117840]), Text sample: "No more Patagonia!" he roared, "no more Tierra del Fuego!" he paused.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 18960]), Text sample: "Certainly!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 249840]), Text sample: He replied to some question, "but not Patagonia," he paused again, and Fisher standing at the foot of the stairs wondered what had occurred to make the visitor so genial.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 201120]), Text sample: "I suppose your cheque will be honoured all right?" asked the visitor sardonically, and then burst into a little chuckle of laughter as he carefully closed the door.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 80400]), Text sample: He came down the corridor talking to himself, and greeted Fisher.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 238800]), Text sample: "Damn all Greeks," he said jovially, and Fisher could do no more than smile reproachfully, the smile being his very own, the reproach being on behalf of the master who paid him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 69120]), Text sample: The traveller touched the other on the chest with his right hand.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89040]), Text sample: "Never trust a Greek," he said, "always get your money in advance.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 144720]), Text sample: "Yes, sir," said Fisher, "but I think you will always find that mr Kara is always most generous about money."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 97680]), Text sample: "Don't you believe it, don't you believe it, my poor man," said the other, "you-"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 84240]), Text sample: At that moment there came from Kara's room a faint "clang."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58800]), Text sample: "What's that?" asked the visitor a little startled.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 218640]), Text sample: "mr Kara's put down his steel latch," said Fisher with a smile, "which means that he is not to be disturbed until-" he looked at his watch, "until eleven o'clock at any rate."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 85920]), Text sample: "He's a funk!" snapped the other, "a beastly funk!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 209760]), Text sample: He stamped down the stairs as though testing the weight of every tread, opened the front door without assistance, slammed it behind him and disappeared into the night.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 127440]), Text sample: Fisher, his hands in his pockets, looked after the departing stranger, nodding his head in reprobation.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 91440]), Text sample: "You're a queer old devil," he said, and looked at his watch again.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53520]), Text sample: It wanted five minutes to ten.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20880]), Text sample: CHAPTER seven
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99120]), Text sample: She had, however, a peculiar taste; she liked to receive cards.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 254160]), Text sample: For what is usually called social intercourse she had very little relish; but nothing pleased her more than to find her hall table whitened with oblong morsels of symbolic pasteboard.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 157680]), Text sample: She flattered herself that she was a very just woman, and had mastered the sovereign truth that nothing in this world is got for nothing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 365040]), Text sample: But it is by no means certain that she did not feel it to be wrong that so little notice was taken of them and that her failure (really very gratuitous) to make herself important in the neighbourhood had not much to do with the acrimony of her allusions to her husband's adopted country.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 267840]), Text sample: Isabel presently found herself in the singular situation of defending the British constitution against her aunt; mrs Touchett having formed the habit of sticking pins into this venerable instrument.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 270720]), Text sample: Isabel always felt an impulse to pull out the pins; not that she imagined they inflicted any damage on the tough old parchment, but because it seemed to her her aunt might make better use of her sharpness.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 302880]), Text sample: She was very critical herself-it was incidental to her age, her sex and her nationality; but she was very sentimental as well, and there was something in mrs Touchett's dryness that set her own moral fountains flowing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78240]), Text sample: "When you criticise everything here you should have a point of view.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 199200]), Text sample: Yours doesn't seem to be American-you thought everything over there so disagreeable. When I criticise I have mine; it's thoroughly American!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65280]), Text sample: You may say that doesn't make them very numerous!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20400]), Text sample: American?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72240]), Text sample: Never in the world; that's shockingly narrow.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63360]), Text sample: My point of view, thank God, is personal!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 232320]), Text sample: Isabel thought this a better answer than she admitted; it was a tolerable description of her own manner of judging, but it would not have sounded well for her to say so.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 306000]), Text sample: Her cousin used, as the phrase is, to chaff her; he very soon established with her a reputation for treating everything as a joke, and he was not a man to neglect the privileges such a reputation conferred.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 96960]), Text sample: "I keep a band of music in my ante room," he said once to her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 106080]), Text sample: "It has orders to play without stopping; it renders me two excellent services.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 207360]), Text sample: It mattered little that he had assured her they were a very dismal place; she would have been glad to undertake to sweep them and set them in order.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 237600]), Text sample: It was but half hospitality to let her remain outside; to punish him for which Isabel administered innumerable taps with the ferule of her straight young wit.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 301920]), Text sample: It must be said that her wit was exercised to a large extent in self defence, for her cousin amused himself with calling her "Columbia" and accusing her of a patriotism so heated that it scorched.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 238080]), Text sample: Isabel's chief dread in life at this period of her development was that she should appear narrow minded; what she feared next afterwards was that she should really be so.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 462480]), Text sample: She would be as American as it pleased him to regard her, and if he chose to laugh at her she would give him plenty of occupation. She defended England against his mother, but when Ralph sang its praises on purpose, as she said, to work her up, she found herself able to differ from him on a variety of points.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 185040]), Text sample: If her good humour flagged at moments it was not because she thought herself ill used, but because she suddenly felt sorry for Ralph.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 115680]), Text sample: It seemed to her he was talking as a blind and had little heart in what he said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 132960]), Text sample: "I don't know what's the matter with you," she observed to him once; "but I suspect you're a great humbug."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 111840]), Text sample: "That's your privilege," Ralph answered, who had not been used to being so crudely addressed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 230400]), Text sample: "I don't know what you care for; I don't think you care for anything. You don't really care for England when you praise it; you don't care for America even when you pretend to abuse it."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 69840]), Text sample: "I care for nothing but you, dear cousin," said Ralph.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 80640]), Text sample: "If I could believe even that, I should be very glad."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 85440]), Text sample: Isabel might have believed it and not have been far from the truth.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 439200]), Text sample: He thought a great deal about her; she was constantly present to his mind. At a time when his thoughts had been a good deal of a burden to him her sudden arrival, which promised nothing and was an open handed gift of fate, had refreshed and quickened them, given them wings and something to fly for.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 173040]), Text sample: The old man had been gravely ill in the spring, and the doctors had whispered to Ralph that another attack would be less easy to deal with.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 260160]), Text sample: Just now he appeared disburdened of pain, but Ralph could not rid himself of a suspicion that this was a subterfuge of the enemy, who was waiting to take him off his guard.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 97680]), Text sample: If the manoeuvre should succeed there would be little hope of any great resistance.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 159600]), Text sample: Ralph had always taken for granted that his father would survive him-that his own name would be the first grimly called.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 498959]), Text sample: The father and son had been close companions, and the idea of being left alone with the remnant of a tasteless life on his hands was not gratifying to the young man, who had always and tacitly counted upon his elder's help in making the best of a poor business. At the prospect of losing his great motive Ralph lost indeed his one inspiration.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 481199]), Text sample: He bethought himself of course that it had been a small kindness to his father to wish that, of the two, the active rather than the passive party should know the felt wound; he remembered that the old man had always treated his own forecast of an early end as a clever fallacy, which he should be delighted to discredit so far as he might by dying first.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 338159]), Text sample: But of the two triumphs, that of refuting a sophistical son and that of holding on a while longer to a state of being which, with all abatements, he enjoyed, Ralph deemed it no sin to hope the latter might be vouchsafed to mr Touchett.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 119040]), Text sample: These were nice questions, but Isabel's arrival put a stop to his puzzling over them.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 186961]), Text sample: He wondered whether he were harbouring "love" for this spontaneous young woman from Albany; but he judged that on the whole he was not.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 150720]), Text sample: After he had known her for a week he quite made up his mind to this, and every day he felt a little more sure.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 141359]), Text sample: Lord Warburton had been right about her; she was a really interesting little figure.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 247680]), Text sample: Ralph wondered how their neighbour had found it out so soon; and then he said it was only another proof of his friend's high abilities, which he had always greatly admired.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 189359]), Text sample: "A character like that," he said to himself-"a real little passionate force to see at play is the finest thing in nature.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 202560]), Text sample: It's finer than the finest work of art-than a Greek bas relief, than a great Titian, than a Gothic cathedral.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 110160]), Text sample: It's very pleasant to be so well treated where one had least looked for it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 231839]), Text sample: I had never been more blue, more bored, than for a week before she came; I had never expected less that anything pleasant would happen.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 139199]), Text sample: The key of a beautiful edifice is thrust into my hand, and I'm told to walk in and admire.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 156480]), Text sample: She was intelligent and generous; it was a fine free nature; but what was she going to do with herself?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 123360]), Text sample: This question was irregular, for with most women one had no occasion to ask it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 230161]), Text sample: Most women did with themselves nothing at all; they waited, in attitudes more or less gracefully passive, for a man to come that way and furnish them with a destiny.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 131759]), Text sample: Isabel's originality was that she gave one an impression of having intentions of her own.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 101279]), Text sample: "Whenever she executes them," said Ralph, "may I be there to see!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 81120]), Text sample: It devolved upon him of course to do the honours of the place.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 296639]), Text sample: mr Touchett was confined to his chair, and his wife's position was that of rather a grim visitor; so that in the line of conduct that opened itself to Ralph duty and inclination were harmoniously mixed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 703920]), Text sample: Isabel enjoyed it largely and, handling the reins in a manner which approved itself to the groom as "knowing," was never weary of driving her uncle's capital horses through winding lanes and byways full of the rural incidents she had confidently expected to find; past cottages thatched and timbered, past ale houses latticed and sanded, past patches of ancient common and glimpses of empty parks, between hedgerows made thick by midsummer.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 226081]), Text sample: When they reached home they usually found tea had been served on the lawn and that mrs Touchett had not shrunk from the extremity of handing her husband his cup.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 383279]), Text sample: The two young persons, after spending an hour on the river, strolled back to the house and perceived Lord Warburton sitting under the trees and engaged in conversation, of which even at a distance the desultory character was appreciable, with mrs Touchett.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 326640]), Text sample: Isabel, seeing him for half an hour on the day of her arrival, had discovered in this brief space that she liked him; he had indeed rather sharply registered himself on her fine sense and she had thought of him several times.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 120721]), Text sample: She had hoped she should see him again-hoped too that she should see a few others.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 329521]), Text sample: Gardencourt was not dull; the place itself was sovereign, her uncle was more and more a sort of golden grandfather, and Ralph was unlike any cousin she had ever encountered-her idea of cousins having tended to gloom.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 188401]), Text sample: Then her impressions were still so fresh and so quickly renewed that there was as yet hardly a hint of vacancy in the view.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 361919]), Text sample: Little, however, for the present, had come of his offers, and it may be confided to the reader that if the young man delayed to carry them out it was because he found the labour of providing for his companion by no means so severe as to require extraneous help.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 345361]), Text sample: Isabel had spoken to him very often about "specimens;" it was a word that played a considerable part in her vocabulary; she had given him to understand that she wished to see English society illustrated by eminent cases.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51121]), Text sample: "A specimen of what?" asked the girl.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46798]), Text sample: "A specimen of an English gentleman."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39121]), Text sample: "Do you mean they're all like him?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48241]), Text sample: "Oh no; they're not all like him."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37200]), Text sample: "Yes, he's very nice.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 135841]), Text sample: The fortunate Lord Warburton exchanged a handshake with our heroine and hoped she was very well.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 91682]), Text sample: "But I needn't ask that," he said, "since you've been handling the oars."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 88081]), Text sample: "I've been rowing a little," Isabel answered; "but how should you know it?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 143282]), Text sample: "Oh, I know he doesn't row; he's too lazy," said his lordship, indicating Ralph Touchett with a laugh.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 150721]), Text sample: "Ah, he has a good excuse for everything!" cried Lord Warburton, still with his sonorous mirth.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 126481]), Text sample: "My excuse for not rowing is that my cousin rows so well," said Ralph. "She does everything well.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56880]), Text sample: She touches nothing that she doesn't adorn!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 424802]), Text sample: "Be touched in the right sense and you'll never look the worse for it," said Isabel, who, if it pleased her to hear it said that her accomplishments were numerous, was happily able to reflect that such complacency was not the indication of a feeble mind, inasmuch as there were several things in which she excelled.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 264481]), Text sample: Lord Warburton not only spent the night at Gardencourt, but he was persuaded to remain over the second day; and when the second day was ended he determined to postpone his departure till the morrow.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 174000]), Text sample: During this period he addressed many of his remarks to Isabel, who accepted this evidence of his esteem with a very good grace.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 372000]), Text sample: She found herself liking him extremely; the first impression he had made on her had had weight, but at the end of an evening spent in his society she scarce fell short of seeing him-though quite without luridity-as a hero of romance.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 192721]), Text sample: "It's very nice to know two such charming people as those," she said, meaning by "those" her cousin and her cousin's friend.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147841]), Text sample: It must be added moreover that an incident had occurred which might have seemed to put her good humour to the test.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 359760]), Text sample: mr Touchett went to bed at half past nine o'clock, but his wife remained in the drawing room with the other members of the party. She prolonged her vigil for something less than an hour, and then, rising, observed to Isabel that it was time they should bid the gentlemen good night.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 69358]), Text sample: So, without further thought, she replied, very simply-
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35279]), Text sample: I'll come up in half an hour."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 80400]), Text sample: "It's impossible I should wait for you," mrs Touchett answered.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68399]), Text sample: Ralph will light my candle," Isabel gaily engaged.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 139441]), Text sample: "I'll light your candle; do let me light your candle, Miss Archer!" Lord Warburton exclaimed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64081]), Text sample: "Only I beg it shall not be before midnight."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 136562]), Text sample: mrs Touchett fixed her bright little eyes upon him a moment and transferred them coldly to her niece.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90481]), Text sample: You're not-you're not at your blest Albany, my dear."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33841]), Text sample: Isabel rose, blushing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65759]), Text sample: "Oh, I say, mother!" Ralph broke out.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 84961]), Text sample: "My dear mrs Touchett!" Lord Warburton murmured.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 138000]), Text sample: "I didn't make your country, my lord," mrs Touchett said majestically. "I must take it as I find it."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 71282]), Text sample: "Can't I stay with my own cousin?" Isabel enquired.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 70561]), Text sample: "I'm not aware that Lord Warburton is your cousin."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 75120]), Text sample: "Perhaps I had better go to bed!" the visitor suggested.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 27841]), Text sample: "That will arrange it."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82802]), Text sample: mrs Touchett gave a little look of despair and sat down again.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 70081]), Text sample: Ralph meanwhile handed Isabel her candlestick.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 159601]), Text sample: He had been watching her; it had seemed to him her temper was involved-an accident that might be interesting.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 212399]), Text sample: But if he had expected anything of a flare he was disappointed, for the girl simply laughed a little, nodded good night and withdrew accompanied by her aunt.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 96481]), Text sample: For himself he was annoyed at his mother, though he thought she was right.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82321]), Text sample: Above stairs the two ladies separated at mrs Touchett's door.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52081]), Text sample: Isabel had said nothing on her way up.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 26880]), Text sample: Isabel considered.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 100322]), Text sample: "I'm not vexed, but I'm surprised-and a good deal mystified.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 61442]), Text sample: Wasn't it proper I should remain in the drawing room?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 29760]), Text sample: "Not in the least.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 134159]), Text sample: Young girls here-in decent houses-don't sit alone with the gentlemen late at night."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63601]), Text sample: "You were very right to tell me then," said Isabel.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 61682]), Text sample: "I don't understand it, but I'm very glad to know it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 164880]), Text sample: "I shall always tell you," her aunt answered, "whenever I see you taking what seems to me too much liberty."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 95519]), Text sample: "Pray do; but I don't say I shall always think your remonstrance just."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 25441]), Text sample: "Very likely not.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44880]), Text sample: You're too fond of your own ways."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 61201]), Text sample: "Yes, I think I'm very fond of them.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72721]), Text sample: But I always want to know the things one shouldn't do."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56880]), Text sample: "So as to do them?" asked her aunt.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 230640]), Text sample: In old times, when all kinds of wonderful things happened in Brittany, there lived in the village of Lanillis, a young man named Houarn Pogamm and a girl called Bellah Postik.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 221520]), Text sample: They were cousins, and as their mothers were great friends, and constantly in and out of each other's houses, they had often been laid in the same cradle, and had played and fought over their games.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 169680]), Text sample: 'Yes,' answered Bellah, with a deep sigh; 'but we live in such hard times, and at the last fair the price of pigs had risen again.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 228000]), Text sample: Whenever they met they repeated their grievances, and at length Houarn's patience was exhausted, and one morning he came to Bellah and told her that he was going away to seek his fortune.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 136560]), Text sample: The girl was very unhappy as she listened to this, and felt sorry that she had not tried to make the best of things.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 128640]), Text sample: Like them, I shall seek till I get what I want-that is, money to buy a cow and a pig to fatten.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 92880]), Text sample: The girl saw it was useless to say more, so she answered sadly:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41040]), Text sample: 'Well, go then, since you must.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 208560]), Text sample: But first I will divide with you all that my parents left me,' and going to her room, she opened a small chest, and took from it a bell, a knife, and a little stick.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 153120]), Text sample: 'This bell,' she said, 'can be heard at any distance, however far, but it only rings to warn us that our friends are in great danger.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147840]), Text sample: The knife frees all it touches from the spells that have been laid on them; while the stick will carry you wherever you want to go.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 134160]), Text sample: I will give you the knife to guard you against the enchantments of wizards, and the bell to tell me of your perils.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 94320]), Text sample: The stick I shall keep for myself, so that I can fly to you if ever you have need of me.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 123360]), Text sample: 'There is no fortune to be made here,' he thought to himself; 'it is a place for spending, and not earning.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 134880]), Text sample: I see I must go further,' and he walked on to Pont aven, a pretty little town built on the bank of a river.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 158640]), Text sample: He was sitting on a bench outside an inn, when he heard two men who were loading their mules talking about the Groac'h of the island of Lok.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 252000]), Text sample: 'I have never come across one.' And the men answered that it was the name given to the fairy that dwelt in the lake, and that she was rich-oh! richer than all the kings in the world put together.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 129120]), Text sample: Many had gone to the island to try and get possession of her treasures, but no one had ever come back.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56160]), Text sample: As he listened Houarn's mind was made up.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 146640]), Text sample: But the men did not know how this was to be done, and, shaking their heads over his obstinacy, left him to his fate.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 109920]), Text sample: So Houarn went down to the sea, and found a boatman who engaged to take him to the isle of Lok.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 126240]), Text sample: The island was large, and lying almost across it was a lake, with a narrow opening to the sea.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 140400]), Text sample: At one end he perceived a small skiff, painted blue and shaped like a swan, lying under a clump of yellow broom.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 144960]), Text sample: But the bird had guessed his intentions, and plunged beneath the water, carrying Houarn with him to the palace of the Groac'h.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 158400]), Text sample: Now, unless you have been under the sea and beheld all the wonders that lie there, you can never have an idea what the Groac'h's palace was like.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 204480]), Text sample: It was all made of shells, blue and green and pink and lilac and white, shading into each other till you could not tell where one colour ended and the other began.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 271680]), Text sample: The staircases were of crystal, and every separate stair sang like a woodland bird as you put your foot on it. Round the palace were great gardens full of all the plants that grow in the sea, with diamonds for flowers.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74880]), Text sample: At the sight of her Houarn stopped, dazzled by her beauty.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56160]), Text sample: 'Come in,' said the Groac'h, rising to her feet.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 76560]), Text sample: Do not be shy, but tell me how you found your way, and what you want.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 102960]), Text sample: 'Well, you can easily get that,' replied she; 'it is nothing to worry about.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65520]), Text sample: 'A man would be mad indeed to refuse such an offer.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42720]), Text sample: I can only accept it with joy.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 95280]), Text sample: 'Then the sooner it is done the better,' said the Groac'h, and gave orders to her servants.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 118320]), Text sample: After that was finished, she begged Houarn to accompany her to a fish pond at the bottom of the garden.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 204480]), Text sample: 'Come lawyer, come miller, come tailor, come singer!' cried she, holding out a net of steel; and at each summons a fish appeared and jumped into the net.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 197040]), Text sample: When it was full she went into a large kitchen and threw them all into a golden pot; but above the bubbling of the water Houarn seemed to hear the whispering of little voices.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 136080]), Text sample: 'The water is getting hot, and it makes the fish jump,' she replied; but soon the noise grew louder and like cries.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66960]), Text sample: 'What is it?' asked Houarn, beginning to feel uncomfortable.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 182640]), Text sample: But though Houarn held his peace, he was not as happy as before. Something seemed to have gone wrong, and then he suddenly remembered Bellah.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67921]), Text sample: 'Is it possible I can have forgotten her so soon?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 193200]), Text sample: Houarn sat down and took out the knife which Bellah had given him, but as soon as the blade touched the fish the enchantment ceased, and four men stood before him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 132000]), Text sample: Instantly she threw the steel net over his head, and the eyes of a little green frog peeped through the meshes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147841]), Text sample: It was at this very moment that Bellah, who was skimming the milk in the farm dairy, heard the fairy bell tinkle violently.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 214080]), Text sample: He stood quite still while Bellah scrambled up, then he started off, his pace growing quicker and quicker, till at length the girl could hardly see the trees and houses as they flashed past.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 110159]), Text sample: But, rapid as the pace was, it was not rapid enough for Bellah, who stooped and said:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 110640]), Text sample: 'The swallow is less swift than the wind, the wind is less swift than the lightning.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 203521]), Text sample: Here she found a nest made of clay and lined with dried moss, and in the centre a tiny man, black and wrinkled, who gave a cry of surprise at the sight of Bellah.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 40079]), Text sample: 'But what are you doing in this nest?'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48000]), Text sample: On hearing this Bellah began to laugh.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78000]), Text sample: 'Poor little cock!' she said, 'and how am I to deliver you?'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 62880]), Text sample: 'By delivering Houarn, who is in the power of the Groac'h.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 150241]), Text sample: 'Ah! tell me how I can manage that, and if I have to walk round the whole of Brittany on my bended knees I will do it!'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 145440]), Text sample: When you have found her you must contrive to get hold of the net of steel that hangs from her waist, and shut her up in it for ever.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63840]), Text sample: 'But where am I to find a young man's clothes?' asked she.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 154800]), Text sample: Without waiting for orders, they sat down in the nest and, crossing their legs comfortably, began to prepare the suit of clothes for Bellah.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 182640]), Text sample: With one of the leaves of the cabbage they made her a coat, and another served for a waistcoat; but it took two for the wide breeches which were then in fashion.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 95279]), Text sample: The hat was cut from the heart of the cabbage, and a pair of shoes from the thick stem.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 162479]), Text sample: She thanked the little men gratefully, and after a few more instructions, jumped on the back of her great bird, and was borne away to the isle of Lok.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 125039]), Text sample: The Groac'h seemed overjoyed to see her, and told her that never before had she beheld such a handsome young man.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 179519]), Text sample: Very soon she led her visitor into the great hall, where wine and fruit were always waiting, and on the table lay the magic knife, left there by Houarn.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 259200]), Text sample: Unseen by the Groac'h, Bellah hid it in a pocket of her green coat, and then followed her hostess into the garden, and to the pond which contained the fish, their sides shining with a thousand different colours.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 117841]), Text sample: Bellah took the net which the Groac'h held out, and, turning rapidly, flung it over the witch's head.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 152880]), Text sample: Bellah only drew it the tighter, and, flinging the sorceress into a pit, she rolled a great stone across the mouth, and left her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 104880]), Text sample: 'This is our lord and master, who has saved us from the net of steel and the pot of gold!'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 204961]), Text sample: But just as she was going to touch the foremost fish, her eyes fell on a green frog on his knees beside her, his little paws crossed over his little heart.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60238]), Text sample: There were so many of them that it took quite a long time.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 31921]), Text sample: 'Here I am!' he exclaimed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 194880]), Text sample: Still he would not leave the farm, and look for work elsewhere, as he might have done, for then he would never see Barbaik at all, and what was life worth to him without that?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 248880]), Text sample: He was tired with a long day's work, and stood with his hand on the mane of one of the animals, waiting till they had done, and thinking all the while of Barbaik, when a voice came out of the gorse close by.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23280]), Text sample: 'What is the matter, Jegu?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65040]), Text sample: The young man glanced up in surprise, and asked who was there.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60240]), Text sample: 'It is I, the brownie of the lake,' replied the voice.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43920]), Text sample: 'But where are you?' inquired Jegu.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 160080]), Text sample: I can take,' he added proudly, 'any shape I choose, and even, which is much harder, be invisible if I want to.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 142080]), Text sample: 'Certainly, if you wish,' and the frog jumped on the back of one of the horses, and changed into a little dwarf, all dressed in green.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 215760]), Text sample: This transformation rather frightened Jegu, but the brownie bade him have no fears, for he would not do him any harm; indeed, he hoped that Jegu might find him of some use.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82560]), Text sample: 'But why should you take all this interest in me?' asked the peasant suspiciously.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 98880]), Text sample: 'Because of a service you did me last winter, which I have never forgotten,' answered the little fellow.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 326640]), Text sample: We were therefore obliged to take refuge in distant lands, and to hide ourselves at first under different animal shapes. Since that time, partly from habit and partly to amuse ourselves, we have continued to transform ourselves, and it was in this way that I got to know you.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60240]), Text sample: 'How?' exclaimed Jegu, filled with astonishment.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 102960]), Text sample: 'Ah! my little brownie, if you can do that, there is nothing I won't give you, except my soul.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 28080]), Text sample: 'That is my affair.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35040]), Text sample: Perhaps I may tell you later.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 84480]), Text sample: Meanwhile you just eat and sleep, and don't worry yourself about anything.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 150000]), Text sample: Jegu declared that nothing could be easier, and then taking off his hat, he thanked the dwarf heartily, and led his horses back to the farm.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 237600]), Text sample: Next morning was a holiday, and Barbaik was awake earlier than usual, as she wished to get through her work as soon as possible, and be ready to start for a dance which was to be held some distance off.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 252960]), Text sample: She went first to the cow house, which it was her duty to keep clean, but to her amazement she found fresh straw put down, the racks filled with hay, the cows milked, and the pails standing neatly in a row.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 186720]), Text sample: To be sure, Jegu only replied roughly that he didn't know what she was talking about, but this answer made her feel all the more certain that it was he and nobody else.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 132000]), Text sample: The same thing took place every day, and never had the cow house been so clean nor the cows so fat.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 153120]), Text sample: Morning and evening Barbaik found her earthen pots full of milk and a pound of butter freshly churned, ornamented with leaves.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 122880]), Text sample: At the end of a few weeks she grew so used to this state of affairs that she only got up just in time to prepare breakfast.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 354960]), Text sample: Soon even this grew to be unnecessary, for a day arrived when, coming downstairs, she discovered that the house was swept, the furniture polished, the fire lit, and the food ready, so that she had nothing to do except to ring the great bell which summoned the labourers from the fields to come and eat it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 205680]), Text sample: This, also, she thought was the work of Jegu, and she could not help feeling that a husband of this sort would be very useful to a girl who liked to lie in bed and to amuse herself.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 84480]), Text sample: Indeed, Barbaik had only to express a wish for it to be satisfied.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 384960]), Text sample: If the wind was cold or the sun was hot and she was afraid to go out lest her complexion should be spoilt, she need only to run down to the spring close by and say softly, 'I should like my churns to be full, and my wet linen to be stretched on the hedge to dry,' and she need never give another thought to the matter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 126960]), Text sample: And she believed that all this was owing to Jegu, and she could no longer do without him, even in her thoughts.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 202560]), Text sample: She would wear the beautiful dresses that came when she wished for them, and visit her neighbours, who would be dying of envy all the while, and she would be able to dance as much as she wished.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89520]), Text sample: Jegu would always be there to work for her and save for her, and watch over her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 115200]), Text sample: The marriage took place the following month, and a few days later the old man died quite suddenly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 140400]), Text sample: Now Jegu had everything to see to himself, and somehow it did not seem so easy as when the farmer was alive.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72960]), Text sample: And all the payment the brownie ever asked for was a bowl of broth.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 178320]), Text sample: From the very day of her marriage Barbaik had noted with surprise and rage that things ceased to be done for her as they had been done all the weeks and months before.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 125520]), Text sample: She complained to Jegu of his laziness, and he only stared at her, not understanding what she was talking about.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32160]), Text sample: Barbaik was furious.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 136798]), Text sample: But when she looked at Jegu and beheld his red face, squinting eyes, and untidy hair, her anger was doubled.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 76801]), Text sample: While now I can receive no presents except from my husband.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82560]), Text sample: Oh, you wretched dwarf, I will never, never forgive you!'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 135841]), Text sample: To her great joy he consented, bidding her set out for the city of the dwarfs and to tell them exactly what she wanted.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56401]), Text sample: Full of excitement, Barbaik started on her journey.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 175200]), Text sample: It was not long, and when she reached the town she went straight to the dwarfs, who were holding counsel in a wide green place, and said to them, 'Listen, my friends!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 133440]), Text sample: She had hardly spoken when the horse appeared, and mounting on his back she started for the village where the wedding was to be held.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65279]), Text sample: At length she caught some words uttered by one man to another.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 95521]), Text sample: 'Why, the farmer's wife has sold her horse's tail!' and turned in her saddle.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 21359]), Text sample: Yes; it was true.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 31680]), Text sample: Her horse had no tail!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 97199]), Text sample: She had forgotten to ask for one, and the wicked dwarfs had carried out her orders to the letter!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 134161]), Text sample: But it was of no use; he declined to move out of a walk; and she was forced to hear all the jokes that were made upon her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 204479]), Text sample: In the evening she returned to the farm more angry than ever, and quite determined to revenge herself on the brownie whenever she had the chance, which happened to be very soon.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 245520]), Text sample: It was the spring, and just the time of year when the dwarfs held their fete, so one day the brownie asked Jegu if he might bring his friends to have supper in the great barn, and whether he would allow them to dance there.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 290159]), Text sample: Of course, Jegu was only too pleased to be able to do anything for the brownie, and he ordered Barbaik to spread her best table cloths in the barn, and to make a quantity of little loaves and pancakes, and, besides, to keep all the milk given by the cows that morning.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 181440]), Text sample: But in a moment they all sprang up with a cry, and ran away screaming, for Barbaik had placed pans of hot coals under their feet, and all their poor little toes were burnt.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 188160]), Text sample: 'You won't forget that in a hurry,' she said, smiling grimly to herself, but in a moment they were back again with large pots of water, which they poured on the fire.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60960]), Text sample: Then they joined hands and danced round it, singing:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34800]), Text sample: Before them is a clear road.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 104160]), Text sample: Not to happiness, as they may believe, but to the opportunity for gaining happiness.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 248640]), Text sample: The goal is not easily won, but they can attain it without the aid of luck or rare gifts or miracles-simply by practicing the common everyday virtues that bring success in all human ventures.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 241920]), Text sample: A young couple's engagement period is like any other time of excited anticipation, when one has received the promise of something greatly desired, but must wait awhile before its delivery.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 216720]), Text sample: The happiness of the waiting period is characterized by the absence of a critical spirit, and therefore is apt to be thought of as an experience of pure delight.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 194160]), Text sample: But the first days of marriage bring out a different set of feelings-those that come when one has definitely obtained possession of anything that before was only promised.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 97920]), Text sample: At first the emotions seem to stand still-this is the long coveted moment!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 40800]), Text sample: Then one begins to appraise.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 84960]), Text sample: Is the object of one's wishes as desirable as one had expected?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 235200]), Text sample: Because reality rarely measures up to imagination, the first answer is almost bound to be, "No, this is not what I expected." And the first emotion tends to be disappointment.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 525840]), Text sample: If one accepts the fact that discrepancy between imagination and reality is inevitable, he is better able to go on to a more thorough examination of the situation, from the fresh viewpoint of finding out just what he has received, regardless of hazy but optimistic expectations; and the object possessed will more than likely turn out to be better than, although different from, what the imagination pictured.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 224160]), Text sample: Knowing that a fleeting sense of disappointment is not peculiar to one's own marriage, but likely to occur in all, as in every other human undertaking, takes away its power to hurt.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 239040]), Text sample: Unworried by any fear of calamity, each marriage partner can turn to account his or her powers of discernment by learning to recognize the assets as well as the liabilities of the partnership.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 159360]), Text sample: Roughly, both the helps and the hindrances to married happiness can be lumped under one word-personalities.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 259920]), Text sample: Temperament, mannerisms, tastes-all that is implied in the distinct individuality of each person-make up the chief source of the advantages and disadvantages with which the couple enter marriage.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44400]), Text sample: These traits cannot be changed overnight.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 199920]), Text sample: Nor is it necessary, or at all wise, that they should be. john attracts Mary, and she appeals to him, because the personality of each one is what it is.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 88080]), Text sample: Love has grown up between the two as a result of this personality attraction.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 107520]), Text sample: And love is the motive that will make both try to keep open the pathway to marriage success.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 126240]), Text sample: But love is not a finished product that, once it comes, can forever after be trusted to keep its strength.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 122400]), Text sample: Like everything else that is alive, it must be kept growing through exercise, or it wastes away.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 100800]), Text sample: Love gives the push that keeps a marriage moving, but it does not give the direction.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 59040]), Text sample: That comes from understanding and cooperation.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 36240]), Text sample: This is what they must guard against.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 110400]), Text sample: While love is still the moving force of their lives, they must study the problems that are due to come.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65040]), Text sample: To wait until they are beset by them is to beg for trouble.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 134400]), Text sample: And finally, they must know what constitutes a happy marriage-what to aim for in their day to day association.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43440]), Text sample: What makes a successful marriage?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 76560]), Text sample: Here are nine guideposts to help john and Mary along their road:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 388800]), Text sample: The smaller issues on which this rests are the lively clashes of opposite desires, inevitable in the coming together of any two persons, intensified when those two persons are as different as a man and a woman, and unavoidable for two committed to a lifetime together in the close quarters of marriage.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 128880]), Text sample: Decisions must be made on the basis of what is good for both, not the selfish or narrow wish of either.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 135840]), Text sample: The choice that brings the larger advantage to the two persons in their common role of marriage partners is the one to be made.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 113760]), Text sample: For example, Mary wants to buy a car, just as john is reckoning that the time has come to build a house.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 148560]), Text sample: Or perhaps he wants to invest money in professional or business advancement at the precise moment when she realizes she wants a child.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 187920]), Text sample: Nor could he, overruling her against her will, find in his choice of home owning or personal career investment the satisfaction he had expected.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 88800]), Text sample: They two, and nobody else, can make the decision to fit their marriage.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 217200]), Text sample: If each one is hurt at the other's inability to join instantly in his, or her, plans, they will need to take pains not to get sidetracked into making a personal contest of the affair.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 310560]), Text sample: Trying to win over your partner with a single eye to getting what you want, regardless of its effect on the mate, is short sighted in the extreme. Even if you could care only for personal pleasure, that cannot long outlast your spouse's displeasure.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 193920]), Text sample: Staging a contest or a succession of small contests, for the sake of finding out who is boss builds up a habit of fighting that may lead to a bitter end.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 80160]), Text sample: It is useless to discover who can win in any particular skirmish.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 192720]), Text sample: What is important is to learn whether one of you is set on being "head of the house." If your spouse craves that distinction, by all means hand it over without delay.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 149040]), Text sample: It is an empty honor, for the one who bends but does not break will readily develop the fine art of influencing the headstrong one.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 159120]), Text sample: Because it is part of the traditional feminine character to enjoy giving in to the man, this tendency must be scrutinized when it appears.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 193440]), Text sample: A woman's feeling that she will be emotionally gratified by making a sacrifice does not prove that, aside from her momentary pleasure, there is any value in it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147120]), Text sample: The ease or difficulty with which husband or wife makes an adjustment in no way measures the worth of that adjustment for their partnership.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 222720]), Text sample: Because of women's recent growth in socially recognized independence, any individual woman may waver between a craving for self sacrifice and a repugnance to the very thought of it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 95520]), Text sample: This changeableness can make her feel resentful after she has given in to her husband.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68160]), Text sample: All this must be taken into account in making decisions.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65520]), Text sample: Compromise, not submission, should be the rule.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 130080]), Text sample: If john forges ahead on one count, Mary must find an acceptable outlet for herself on some other front.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89279]), Text sample: Respect for the other member of the marriage association is a must have.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 312481]), Text sample: Nobody can suddenly change his personality at will, and the effort to do so to please the partner is liable to result in a topheavy hypocrisy-a superstructure calculated to impress the observer, but built on a shaky foundation of chaos.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 165360]), Text sample: The changes a husband or wife makes in the partner's total personality are in the nature of altered emphasis in the expression of traits already present.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 190079]), Text sample: These minor changes occur as by products of active response to the personality of the mate in many small daily contacts, and not as a result of exhortation.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 224160]), Text sample: Nor are they necessarily permanent. A chameleon changes color easily to match its environment or temper of the moment, but a human being's more lasting change is not so readily made.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 106319]), Text sample: Each marriage partner must be proud of the other and let the other continue to be proud of him or her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 87361]), Text sample: Therefore you have to respect yourself and act as if you did, even at home.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78960]), Text sample: Too many couples exploit the sense of let down that marriage brings with it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 122399]), Text sample: After so long a time, husband and wife cease to feel that they must exert themselves for each other in little matters.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 143519]), Text sample: Knowing themselves accepted, they lounge-mentally, mannerly, and physically-when at home or elsewhere alone together.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 178079]), Text sample: Some of this relaxation is a good thing, but it is a mistake to let home and spouse degenerate into nothing more than an invitation to be lazy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 126479]), Text sample: If you are tired or irritable, you can rest or exercise for restoration, as in the days before marriage.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 118320]), Text sample: Fatigue and nervousness, expressed, breed fatigue and nervousness in a sympathetic audience.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52079]), Text sample: Too great concentration is to be avoided.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 91440]), Text sample: Even the greatest love stagnates if it is kept out of the main current of life.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 240719]), Text sample: This is why the unique value of children is their service as an entering wedge in the close grown love of husband and wife, a wedge that widens and holds forever wider the unity of love it has penetrated.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 167520]), Text sample: Other responsibilities, other interests, may serve a similar purpose, though more easily dislodged and seldom striking so deep.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 115200]), Text sample: Friends, old and new, have a function in relieving the overclose concern of one marriage partner with the other.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 190560]), Text sample: Common friends are fine, but for this purpose there is special need of friends for either spouse who can call forth those sides of his or her nature that are not aroused by the mate.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 205919]), Text sample: The factor that underlies all the perplexities, and most of the contentment, of marriage is its unique degree of concentrated intimacy. Here the supreme testing always comes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 155759]), Text sample: Each means so much to the other, each needs so much from the other, that there can be no halfway satisfaction in being together.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 93118]), Text sample: But there will come a first time when john is too tired to go out with Mary, or vice versa.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 62639]), Text sample: The wife may be alone part of the day and profit by it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65759]), Text sample: When john comes home at night, he has not had that privilege.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 98880]), Text sample: The general level of emotion is what counts, not the spectacular scaling of peaks.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 269041]), Text sample: Some husbands, some wives, are artists at achieving and momentarily living up to romantic settings, but quickly flop down to the lower levels of decent fairness between the high spots of their sentimental flare ups.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 182161]), Text sample: Others cannot utter a poetic phrase, make a romantic gesture, or let their eyes show the quick intensity of their tender emotions if they must die for it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 76801]), Text sample: This difference is one of make-up and training, not of marriage capacity.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 119521]), Text sample: Another terrible moment that is due to come may seem even more frightening because it is you who are slipping.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 98161]), Text sample: Soon or late you find that some familiar mannerism of your spouse displeases you.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 192238]), Text sample: It may be a slight uncouthness at table, a peculiar back country phrase or pronunciation, some gesture of timidity or swaggering.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41039]), Text sample: And your vexation terrifies you.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 59519]), Text sample: Does this mean that you no longer love your mate as you did?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 38642]), Text sample: You cannot help your change of feeling.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 116880]), Text sample: How, then, can you hope to keep your affection from disappearing altogether if it has already begun to wane?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 157920]), Text sample: You remember other people you once thought you loved, and wonder, panic stricken, how you can keep this love from dying as those other loves did.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 317760]), Text sample: This is probably an almost universal experience, marking, not the beginning of the end of love, but the passage from an adolescent type of blind devotion to a more mature affection that persists in spite of being able to admit the flaws it sees.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 94079]), Text sample: For the very young a person must register one hundred percent or be rejected.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 205681]), Text sample: Now that you can see your mate more clearly, you should also be able to see more accurately his, or her, good points, which before were hidden from you in the mist of your enthusiasm.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 83280]), Text sample: Your love is now becoming less self centered and more helpful to your partner.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 85440]), Text sample: There can be no holding on to the present nor seeking to bring back the past.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 29281]), Text sample: The tale is never told.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78240]), Text sample: There can be no narrowing of marriage to mere sex adjustment.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 151202]), Text sample: To interpret the marriage association as little more than sex is to throw away all chance of success, even in the realm of sex.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 270241]), Text sample: As a continuing part of this life adjustment, sex adjustment can develop into a permanent factor of married happiness; but without the larger adjustment, the partial adjustment cannot be made in any fundamental and enduring form.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 152639]), Text sample: In the sex life in marriage, as in other parts of the association, each partner wins by considering the other before the self.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 103199]), Text sample: At no point can the domination of either partner over the other take the place of adjustment.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 192721]), Text sample: One who prides himself or herself on having to be handled with gloves has a great deal of growing up to do in order to be able to be an active partner in the marriage.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 261601]), Text sample: In the healthy marriage, this sympathetic response will soon give way to anger, which in turn may have the effect of a dash of cold water in the face of the oversensitive one, helping him or her to buck up and behave like an adult.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 131039]), Text sample: In the unhealthy marriage, sympathy will grow into pity, which drives out the indispensable attitude of respect.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 219120]), Text sample: Both get hurt, but the weak person does nothing but squeal about it, while the robust ignores it except for trying to take some constructive step to prevent future occasions for hurt.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 157919]), Text sample: The marriage partner who is mature will maintain trust in the other's good intentions in the face of what might seem to be occasions for hurt feelings.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 83279]), Text sample: A chief advantage of the married estate is its opportunity for frankness.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 174481]), Text sample: "Why doesn't his wife tell him of that unpleasant mannerism, so he can correct it?" bears witness to the universal appreciation of this function of married life.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 273360]), Text sample: But if john nurses hurt feelings whenever Mary punctures his vanity by suggesting that he presents to the world a less than perfect front, Mary may soon lose courage and relinquish her wifely job of husband improvement.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48720]), Text sample: Frankness must go clothed in tact.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 100081]), Text sample: Stiff minded people who are frank only when angry lose their case before they present it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 167520]), Text sample: If the expression of anger is to have its proper stimulative effect, it has to be administered but rarely, and then in small doses.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 189120]), Text sample: More has a paralyzing effect on the recipient, producing a response in kind that takes away the ability to think of anything except retaliation.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 117841]), Text sample: We are all immature at some points, but we can welcome opportunities for growth, painful though they may be.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 91919]), Text sample: As this is an impossibility, they are aware of increasing dissatisfaction.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54000]), Text sample: That does not mean they are unadapted to each other.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24960]), Text sample: No, they hadn't.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 145920]), Text sample: It was wet and besmirched with mud, and, in fact was lying half in and half out of a little puddle of water when it was found.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37200]), Text sample: But in this they were disappointed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41040]), Text sample: Of this there was no doubt whatever.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39600]), Text sample: Here was a deepening of the mystery.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 110880]), Text sample: Squire Harrington was especially active, and left no stone unturned to unravel the mystery.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 119280]), Text sample: Lapierre gave up all his time to the search, and left the Royal Oak to the care of its landlady.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 304080]), Text sample: Every place, likely and unlikely, where a man's body might possibly lie concealed; every tract of bush and woodland; every barn and out building; every hollow and ditch; every field and fence corner, was explored with careful minuteness.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 136560]), Text sample: Doctor Scott, the local coroner, held himself in readiness to summon a coroner's jury at the shortest notice.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24480]), Text sample: All to no purpose.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64800]), Text sample: He lay there still shivering, beneath the heavy blankets.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 114000]), Text sample: "I don't dare!" He echoed Graham's words. "There's nothing else any one can say.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 31920]), Text sample: I must decide what to do.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24480]), Text sample: I must think it over."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64800]), Text sample: But, as always, thought brought no release.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66480]), Text sample: It merely insisted that the case against him was proved.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 70560]), Text sample: After this something must be done about Paredes's detention.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 62640]), Text sample: He raised himself on his elbow and glanced from the window.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 153120]), Text sample: Two burly fellows in overalls, carrying pick and spade across their shoulders, pushed through the underbrush at the edge of the clearing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 17040]), Text sample: He turned.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64080]), Text sample: Graham, fully dressed, stood at the side of the bed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42720]), Text sample: "Those men?" Bobby asked wearily.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39840]), Text sample: "The grave diggers," Graham answered.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 36720]), Text sample: That's why I've come to wake you up.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 40800]), Text sample: The minister's telephoned Katherine.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 29280]), Text sample: He will be here before noon.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33600]), Text sample: Do you know it's after ten o'clock?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 86640]), Text sample: For some time Bobby stared through the window at the desolate, ragged landscape.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54960]), Text sample: It was abnormally cold even for the late fall.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 88800]), Text sample: Dull clouds obscured the sun and furnished an illusion of crowding earthward.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23520]), Text sample: "A funereal day."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 100080]), Text sample: "When your grandfather's buried," Graham answered softly, "we'll all feel happier."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 30960]), Text sample: "Why?" Bobby asked.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39600]), Text sample: "It won't lessen the fact of his murder."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 103920]), Text sample: "Time," Graham said, "lessens such facts-even for the police."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35280]), Text sample: Bobby glanced at him, flushing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 21600]), Text sample: Graham smiled.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35280]), Text sample: I slept like a top last night.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 18480]), Text sample: I saw nothing."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 21600]), Text sample: Graham frowned.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46320]), Text sample: "He shouldn't be in jail," Bobby persisted.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 30960]), Text sample: "Get up," Graham advised.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 38880]), Text sample: As far as possible you must."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 27120]), Text sample: Bobby sprang upright.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 25440]), Text sample: "How can I forget it?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67680]), Text sample: If it was hard to face sleep before, what do you think it is now?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 25440]), Text sample: "Don't," Graham said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 129120]), Text sample: When Bobby had bathed and dressed he found, in spite of his mental turmoil, that his sleep had done him good.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60240]), Text sample: "The manager took my advice, but Maria's still missing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39840]), Text sample: Her pictures are in most of the papers.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 38160]), Text sample: "Where's Robinson?" Bobby asked.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 36960]), Text sample: "He learned nothing new last night?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 18720]), Text sample: I gather not."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23040]), Text sample: Bobby looked up.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 61440]), Text sample: "Isn't that an automobile coming through the woods?" he asked.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44160]), Text sample: The car stopped at the entrance of the court.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54960]), Text sample: They heard the remote tinkling of the front door bell.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 26400]), Text sample: Jenkins passed through.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 226800]), Text sample: The cold air invading the hall and the dining room told them he had opened the door. His sharp exclamation recalled Howells's report which, at their direction, he had failed to mail.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51840]), Text sample: Had his exclamation been drawn by an accuser?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 30720]), Text sample: Bobby started to rise.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 30960]), Text sample: Graham moved toward the door.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53520]), Text sample: He appeared, moreover, to have slept pleasantly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 16560]), Text sample: "Good morning.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49920]), Text sample: I've nearly frozen driving from Smithtown."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 73200]), Text sample: Before either man could grope for a suitable greeting he faced Bobby.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 59040]), Text sample: "Fact is, Bobby, I left New York too suddenly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 18720]), Text sample: I thought you were-"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63120]), Text sample: Graham interrupted with a flat demand for an explanation.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24240]), Text sample: "How did you get away?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 25920]), Text sample: "Later, mr Graham.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68640]), Text sample: There is a hack driver outside who is even more suspicious than you.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24960]), Text sample: He wants to be paid.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 123840]), Text sample: I asked Rawlins to drive me back, but he rushed from the courthouse, probably to telephone his rotund superior.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 79440]), Text sample: Fact is, this fellow wants five dollars-an outrageous rate.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 13920]), Text sample: Thanks."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47040]), Text sample: He surveyed the remains of Bobby's breakfast.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57120]), Text sample: Bobby tried to account for Paredes's friendly manner.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44880]), Text sample: Only one theory promised to fit at all.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72720]), Text sample: It was necessary for the Panamanian to return to the Cedars.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 124800]), Text sample: His purpose, whatever it was, compelled him to remain for the present in the mournful, tragic house.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66720]), Text sample: Therefore, he would crush his justifiable anger.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 79680]), Text sample: He would make it practically impossible for Bobby to refuse his hospitality.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 179760]), Text sample: Paredes's arrival possessed one virtue: It diverted Bobby's thoughts temporarily from his own dilemma, from his inability to chart a course.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 50400]), Text sample: Graham, on the other hand, was ill at ease.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 75360]), Text sample: For him yesterday's incident was not so lightly to be passed over.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47520]), Text sample: Eventually his curiosity conquered.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63840]), Text sample: The words came, nevertheless, with some difficulty:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37440]), Text sample: "We scarcely expected you back."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33600]), Text sample: His laugh was short and embarrassed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 28560]), Text sample: "Splendid coffee!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39600]), Text sample: You should have tasted what I had this morning.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 31200]), Text sample: Simple enough, mr Graham.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56400]), Text sample: I telephoned as soon as Rawlins got me to the Bastille.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35280]), Text sample: He planned it with some local fellow.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 92640]), Text sample: He fixed a pretty stiff bail, but the local lawyer was there with a bondsman, and I came back.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20160]), Text sample: My clothes are here.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 27600]), Text sample: You don't mind, Bobby?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 94560]), Text sample: That moment in the hall when Graham had awakened him urged Bobby to reply with a genuine warmth:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23280]), Text sample: I'm glad you're out of it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57600]), Text sample: Your presence in the private staircase was the last straw.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34560]), Text sample: You will forgive us, Carlos?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 50400]), Text sample: He put down his coffee cup and lighted a cigarette.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44160]), Text sample: He smoked with a vast contentment.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20160]), Text sample: "That's better.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 30720]), Text sample: Nothing to forgive, Bobby.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 36720]), Text sample: Let us call it a misunderstanding."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 25920]), Text sample: Graham moved closer.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54479]), Text sample: His eyes still smiled, but his voice was harder:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35760]), Text sample: "Bygones are bygones.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41762]), Text sample: "Since you wish it," Bobby said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82560]), Text sample: But more important than the knowledge Graham desired, loomed the old question.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 26880]), Text sample: What was the man's game?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23760]), Text sample: Robinson entered.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32639]), Text sample: Clearly he had slept little.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37681]), Text sample: "I saw you arrive," he said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 132479]), Text sample: "Since the law won't hold me at your convenience in Smithtown I keep myself at your service here-if Bobby permits it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23041]), Text sample: Could you ask more?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 100800]), Text sample: That fleeting, satanic impression of yesterday came back, sharper, more alarming.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 225840]), Text sample: His reserve and easy daring mastered them all; and always, as now, he laughed at the futility of their efforts to sound his purposes, to limit his freedom of action.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 105599]), Text sample: Bobby didn't care to meet the uncommunicative eyes whose depths he had never been able to explore.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 173521]), Text sample: Was there a special power there that could control the destinies of other people, that might make men walk unconsciously to accomplish the ends of an unscrupulous brain?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68399]), Text sample: The district attorney appeared as much at sea as the others.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 71760]), Text sample: "You've no objection to the gentleman visiting you for the present?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44640]), Text sample: "I've been watching the preparations out there.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 116880]), Text sample: "I suppose not," Robinson sneered, "since everybody knows well enough what's in it."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 55678]), Text sample: "You'll be at the grave-as chief mourner?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32161]), Text sample: Bobby walked from the room.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54960]), Text sample: He put on his coat and hat and left the house.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 70081]), Text sample: But almost immediately even that prophylactic was denied him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 115440]), Text sample: With his direction a matter of indifference, chance led him into the thicket at the side of the house.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39599]), Text sample: He had walked some distance.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 279121]), Text sample: The underbrush had long interposed a veil between him and the Cedars above whose roofs smoke wreathed in the still air like fantastic figures weaving a shroud to lower over the time stained, melancholy walls.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 138720]), Text sample: For once he was grateful to the forest because it had forbidden him to glance perpetually back at that dismal and pensive picture.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 223202]), Text sample: Then he became aware of twigs hastily lopped off, of bushes bent and torn, of the uncovering, through these careless means, of an old path.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 31920]), Text sample: He paused, listening.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 111600]), Text sample: The labour of the men was given an uncouth rhythm by their grunting expulsions of breath.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 151440]), Text sample: Otherwise the nature of their industry and its surroundings had imposed upon them a silence, in itself beast like and unnatural.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63121]), Text sample: Its brevity pointed the previous dumbness of the speaker:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 17519]), Text sample: "Deep enough!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 109440]), Text sample: He could see where the men had had to tear bushes from among the graves in order to insert their tools.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 76319]), Text sample: There was an ironical justice in the condition of the old cemetery.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 118798]), Text sample: Like everything about the Cedars, Silas Blackburn had delivered it to the swift, obliterating fingers of time.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 131760]), Text sample: This necessary task on which Bobby had stumbled had made the thicket less congenial than the house.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 91199]), Text sample: As he walked back he forecasted with a keen apprehension his approaching ordeal.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 136801]), Text sample: It would, doubtless, be more difficult to endure than Howells's experiment over Silas Blackburn's body in the old room.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 268560]), Text sample: Could he witness the definite imprisonment of his grandfather in a narrow box; could he watch the covering earth fall noisily in that bleak place of silence without displaying for Robinson the guilt that impressed him more and more?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 77040]), Text sample: A strange man appeared, walking from the direction of the house.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 221039]), Text sample: His black clothing, relieved only by narrow edges of white cuffs between the sleeves and the heavy mourning gloves, fitted with solemn harmony into the landscape and Bobby's mood.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66481]), Text sample: He was glad to see Graham leave the court and hurry toward him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42000]), Text sample: "I was coming to hunt you up, Bobby.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 26400]), Text sample: The minister's arrived.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 25681]), Text sample: So has Doctor Groom.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 26640]), Text sample: Everything's about ready."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 17760]), Text sample: "Doctor Groom?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33121]), Text sample: Bobby agreed indifferently.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46079]), Text sample: They walked slowly back to the house.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 81120]), Text sample: Graham made it plain that his mind was far from the sad business ahead.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 38880]), Text sample: "He ignores what happened yesterday.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42480]), Text sample: He settles himself in the Cedars again."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49440]), Text sample: "I don't know what to think of it," Bobby answered.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49440]), Text sample: "This morning Carlos gave me the creeps."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 28801]), Text sample: "Gave me the creeps, too.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 95519]), Text sample: He suggests resources as hard to understand as anything that has happened in the old room.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 111121]), Text sample: You'll confess, Bobby, he's had a good deal of influence over you-an influence for evil?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54720]), Text sample: "I won't blame Carlos for that," Bobby muttered.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46798]), Text sample: "Maria did her share," Bobby said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35519]), Text sample: He broke off, looking at Graham.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24960]), Text sample: "What are you driving at?"

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 149041]), Text sample: Excuse me, excuse me, but I owe this money to the charity fund,--a deposit which I promised to pay this morning."

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 169919]), Text sample: "Certainly, I excuse you," said Monte Cristo graciously, "and pocket them." And he placed the bonds in his pocket book.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 110401]), Text sample: "But," said Danglars, "there is still a sum of one hundred thousand francs?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 98880]), Text sample: "The balance would come to about that sum; but keep it, and we shall be quits."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 104400]), Text sample: At the door he found his carriage, and was immediately driven to the bank.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 196560]), Text sample: My funds are deposited there, and you can understand that if I draw out ten millions on the same day it will appear rather strange to the governor.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 71762]), Text sample: Two days will be a different thing," said Danglars, smiling.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34318]), Text sample: "Thank you, no, sir."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 29759]), Text sample: "Then it will be to morrow."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34801]), Text sample: "Yes; but without fail."

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 12959]), Text sample: What?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51359]), Text sample: That must have been One Hundred and Twelfth back there.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 111599]), Text sample: Apartments along here expensive-probably hundred and fifty a month-maybe two hundred.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 173279]), Text sample: What a dirty river-want to go down there and see if it's dirty-French rivers all brown or black, so were Southern rivers.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78240]), Text sample: No desire to sleep with Jill, what could Alec see in her?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47039]), Text sample: Alec had a coarse taste in women.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 189120]), Text sample: Own taste the best; Isabelle, Clara, Rosalind, Eleanor, were all American. Eleanor would pitch, probably southpaw.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 106801]), Text sample: Rosalind was outfield, wonderful hitter, Clara first base, maybe.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35041]), Text sample: Where's the darned bell-

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 118320]), Text sample: There, an opening made for the purpose gave them access to the aluminum car.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 264240]), Text sample: Nicholl, once introduced with his companions inside the projectile, began to close the opening by means of a strong plate, held in position by powerful screws.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 265440]), Text sample: Other plates, closely fitted, covered the lenticular glasses, and the travelers, hermetically enclosed in their metal prison, were plunged in profound darkness.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 61200]), Text sample: And first let us try and see a little.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 517680]), Text sample: So saying, the thoughtless fellow lit a match by striking it on the sole of his boot; and approached the burner fixed to the receptacle, in which the carbonized hydrogen, stored at high pressure, sufficed for the lighting and warming of the projectile for a hundred and forty four hours, or six days and six nights.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 294480]), Text sample: The gas caught fire, and thus lighted the projectile looked like a comfortable room with thickly padded walls, furnished with a circular divan, and a roof rounded in the shape of a dome.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 259680]), Text sample: "It is a prison," said he, "but a traveling prison; and, with the right of putting my nose to the window, I could well stand a lease of a hundred years.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 138240]), Text sample: While Michel Ardan was speaking, Barbicane and Nicholl were making their last preparations.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 330240]), Text sample: Nicholl's chronometer marked twenty minutes past ten p m when the three travelers were finally enclosed in their projectile. This chronometer was set within the tenth of a second by that of Murchison the engineer.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 36720]), Text sample: Barbicane consulted it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 303840]), Text sample: At forty seven minutes past ten Murchison will launch the electric spark on the wire which communicates with the charge of the Columbiad. At that precise moment we shall leave our spheroid.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 110400]), Text sample: Thus we still have twenty seven minutes to remain on the earth."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 160800]), Text sample: "Well!" exclaimed Michel Ardan, in a good humored tone, "much may be done in twenty six minutes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 280560]), Text sample: The gravest questions of morals and politics may be discussed, and even solved. Twenty six minutes well employed are worth more than twenty six years in which nothing is done.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 107520]), Text sample: "And you conclude, then, you everlasting talker?" asked Barbicane.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51840]), Text sample: "Twenty four only," said Nicholl.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 169920]), Text sample: "Well, twenty four, if you like, my noble captain," said Ardan; "twenty four minutes in which to investigate----"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 273360]), Text sample: "Michel," said Barbicane, "during the passage we shall have plenty of time to investigate the most difficult questions. For the present we must occupy ourselves with our departure."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 152640]), Text sample: "Doubtless; but there are still some precautions to be taken, to deaden as much as possible the first shock."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 168000]), Text sample: "Have we not the water cushions placed between the partition breaks, whose elasticity will sufficiently protect us?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 123600]), Text sample: "I hope so, Michel," replied Barbicane gently, "but I am not sure."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 180960]), Text sample: "He hopes!--He is not sure!-- and he waits for the moment when we are encased to make this deplorable admission!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41520]), Text sample: I beg to be allowed to get out!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54240]), Text sample: "And how?" asked Barbicane.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35520]), Text sample: "Twenty," said Nicholl.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 180960]), Text sample: For some moments the three travelers looked at each other. Then they began to examine the objects imprisoned with them.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 324960]), Text sample: "We have now to decide how we can best place ourselves to resist the shock. Position cannot be an indifferent matter; and we must, as much as possible, prevent the rush of blood to the head."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41760]), Text sample: "Just so," said Nicholl.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 166320]), Text sample: "No," said Barbicane, "let us stretch ourselves on our sides; we shall resist the shock better that way.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 192240]), Text sample: Remember that, when the projectile starts, it matters little whether we are in it or before it; it amounts to much the same thing."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90480]), Text sample: "Do you approve of my idea, Nicholl?" asked Barbicane.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51120]), Text sample: "Entirely," replied the captain.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58320]), Text sample: "We've still thirteen minutes and a half."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 192960]), Text sample: "That Nicholl is not a man," exclaimed Michel; "he is a chronometer with seconds, an escape, and eight holes."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 157680]), Text sample: But his companions were not listening; they were taking up their last positions with the most perfect coolness.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 153840]), Text sample: They were like two methodical travelers in a car, seeking to place themselves as comfortably as possible.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 229200]), Text sample: We might well ask ourselves of what materials are the hearts of these Americans made, to whom the approach of the most frightful danger added no pulsation.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 121200]), Text sample: Three thick and solidly made couches had been placed in the projectile.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 107280]), Text sample: Nicholl and Barbicane placed them in the center of the disc forming the floor.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 116880]), Text sample: There the three travelers were to stretch themselves some moments before their departure.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 438720]), Text sample: During this time, Ardan, not being able to keep still, turned in his narrow prison like a wild beast in a cage, chatting with his friends, speaking to the dogs Diana and Satellite, to whom, as may be seen, he had given significant names.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34560]), Text sample: "Ah, Diana!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 220801]), Text sample: Ah, Satellite!" he exclaimed, teasing them; "so you are going to show the moon dogs the good habits of the dogs of the earth!

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 171359]), Text sample: "There are," said Michel Ardan, "just as there are horses, cows, donkeys, and chickens.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53280]), Text sample: I bet that we shall find chickens."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 80880]), Text sample: "A hundred dollars we shall find none!" said Nicholl.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 561840]), Text sample: "Done, my captain!" replied Ardan, clasping Nicholl's hand. "But, by the bye, you have already lost three bets with our president, as the necessary funds for the enterprise have been found, as the operation of casting has been successful, and lastly, as the Columbiad has been loaded without accident, six thousand dollars."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35519]), Text sample: "Yes," replied Nicholl.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 76079]), Text sample: "Thirty seven minutes six seconds past ten."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35039]), Text sample: "It is understood, captain.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 356399]), Text sample: Well, before another quarter of an hour you will have to count nine thousand dollars to the president; four thousand because the Columbiad will not burst, and five thousand because the projectile will rise more than six miles in the air."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56880]), Text sample: "I only ask to be allowed to pay."

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 229920]), Text sample: I see that you are a man of method, which I could never be; but indeed you have made a series of bets of very little advantage to yourself, allow me to tell you."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45841]), Text sample: "And why?" asked Nicholl.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 210721]), Text sample: "Because, if you gain the first, the Columbiad will have burst, and the projectile with it; and Barbicane will no longer be there to reimburse your dollars."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 194400]), Text sample: "My stake is deposited at the bank in Baltimore," replied Barbicane simply; "and if Nicholl is not there, it will go to his heirs."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63360]), Text sample: "Forty two minutes past ten!" said Nicholl.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 492238]), Text sample: "Yes, five little minutes!" replied Michel Ardan; "and we are enclosed in a projectile, at the bottom of a gun nine hundred feet long!

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 341760]), Text sample: And friend Murchison, with his chronometer in hand, his eye fixed on the needle, his finger on the electric apparatus, is counting the seconds preparatory to launching us into interplanetary space."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 124319]), Text sample: "Enough, Michel, enough!" said Barbicane, in a serious voice; "let us prepare.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 98640]), Text sample: A few instants alone separate us from an eventful moment.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 83040]), Text sample: "Forty seven minutes past ten!" murmured the captain.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 328560]), Text sample: "Twenty seconds more!" Barbicane quickly put out the gas and lay down by his companions, and the profound silence was only broken by the ticking of the chronometer marking the seconds.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 309120]), Text sample: Suddenly a dreadful shock was felt, and the projectile, under the force of six billions of litres of gas, developed by the combustion of pyroxyle, mounted into space.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 301200]), Text sample: Strange as it may seem, this sphere, which for convenience we will call Brief, revolves very slowly on its axis, so that our world makes fifteen times as many revolutions as this planet.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 126480]), Text sample: It appears that on all worlds everything is regulated in accordance with the length of human life.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 360240]), Text sample: Furrows of care and trouble begin to deepen on the faces of these Briefites as they approach an age of what we would call three years, and if by lease of strength they pass on toward an age of four years, it is but an evidence of their exceptional vitality.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 18000]), Text sample: JOURNALISM.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 326160]), Text sample: Things happen in such quick succession that the news is hustled out at all hours of the day and night; not on sheets of paper, but through automatic news receivers, machines somewhat akin to our telegraph instruments.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 80640]), Text sample: But compared to our customs, the news is very scarce.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 112800]), Text sample: There being no competition, no time or space is required for sensational trash.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89520]), Text sample: Thus, if nothing of importance occurs, nothing need be transmitted.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 242160]), Text sample: There are indeed some advantages in the government being in constant touch with each home under its care. The advertising department pays nearly all expenses of this whole system of journalism.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 379920]), Text sample: If one of the Briefites were to step upon the shores of our rugged Earth and see the cotton or wool and leather that lies around our feet, it would appear to him as the most ridiculous thing imaginable, and no doubt his shapely feet of ivory cast would be of more than passing interest to us.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 22080]), Text sample: THEIR RAIMENT.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56160]), Text sample: Their raiment is altogether after new models.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 247920]), Text sample: Suffice it to say that a person, in lightning rapidity of motion, rushes from a store, springs upon a passing seat and is hurled away by the power of an overhead cable system.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 128640]), Text sample: I have no words of praise for this system, although the Briefites can cover considerable territory in an hour.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 156480]), Text sample: They look upon this gravity system as a wonderful achievement, for it has not been in operation for more than three hundred years.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56160]), Text sample: The power of steam has never been utilized.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 240000]), Text sample: But they have discovered what we would call gaseous oil, and have learned to put it to work, so that it is the main force employed in hoisting and all other purposes where power is required.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 240240]), Text sample: Nothing like a traveling locomotive has ever been made, although I learned that a bright wizard was experimenting and that he prophesied great changes when his gas propelled vehicle was perfected.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 212161]), Text sample: Quadrupeds that take the place of our horses are used for drayage, although nothing except the two wheeled class of vehicles was ever used until some eighty seven years ago.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 102721]), Text sample: The name of their Redeemer, phonetically rendered, is Kerm Cher.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 140880]), Text sample: The most faithful translation of this word into our language would be God affluence.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 120959]), Text sample: Similar to Christ, he confirmed his identity by unanswerable miracles.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 143281]), Text sample: Many, however, disbelieved in Kerm Cher, and held to the old axiomatic truths.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 153359]), Text sample: Thus creeds were prevalent and they remain until now, only there is much less variety than is found amongst us.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147840]), Text sample: Moisture from the night's rain hung on the tree leaves, clung in globules to Rynch's sweating body.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 132240]), Text sample: He lay on a wide branch trying to control the heavy panting which supplied his laboring lungs.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 212160]), Text sample: And he could still hear the echoes of the startled cries which had come from the men who had threaded through the woods to the up pointed tail fins of the L B.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63840]), Text sample: Now he tried to reason why he had run.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 172800]), Text sample: They were his own kind, they would take him out of the loneliness of a world heretofore empty of his species.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 137760]), Text sample: But that tall man-the one who had led the party into the irregular clearing about the life boat-
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 114000]), Text sample: Rynch shivered, dug his nails into the wood on which he lay.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 176400]), Text sample: At the sight of that man, dream and reality had crashed together, sending him into panic stricken flight.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89520]), Text sample: That was the man from the room-the man with the cup!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 86880]), Text sample: As his heart quieted he began to think more coherently.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147840]), Text sample: Then the marks on the ground at the point from which he had fallen and the L B were here, just as he remembered.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 273840]), Text sample: But not far from the small ship he had discovered something more-a campsite with a shelter fashioned out of spalls and vines, containing possessions a castaway might have accumulated.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 111360]), Text sample: That man would come, Rynch was sure of that, but he was too spent to struggle on.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90720]), Text sample: No, the answer to every part of the puzzle lay with that man.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 194400]), Text sample: To go back to the ship clearing was to risk capture-but he had to know. Rynch looked with more attention at his present surroundings.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 69840]), Text sample: Deep mold under the trees here would hold tracks.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46800]), Text sample: There might just be another way to move.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65520]), Text sample: He eyed the spread of limbs on a neighbor tree.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 158880]), Text sample: His journey through those heights was awkward and he sweated and cringed when he disturbed vocal treetop dwellers.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 127920]), Text sample: He was also to discover that close to the site of the L B crash others waited.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 148560]), Text sample: He huddled against the bole of a tree when he made out the curve of a round bulk holding tight to the tree trunk aloft.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 226080]), Text sample: Though it was balled in upon itself he was sure the creature was fully as large as he, and the menacing claws suggested it was a formidable opponent.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 222000]), Text sample: When it made no move to follow him Rynch began to hope it had only been defending its own hiding place, for its present attitude suggested concealment.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 377520]), Text sample: Still facing that featureless blob in the tree, the man retreated, alert for the first sign of advance on the part of the creature above. None came, and he dared to slip around the bole of the tree under which he stood, listening intently for any corresponding movement overhead.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 55440]), Text sample: Now he was facing that survivor's camp.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 145920]), Text sample: Another object crouched in the dark of the lean to shelter, just as its fellow was on sentry duty in the tree!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82800]), Text sample: Only this one did not have the self color of the foliage to disguise it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 111840]), Text sample: Dark pits for eyes showed no pupil, iris, or cornea.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 149040]), Text sample: The nose was a black, perfectly rounded tube jutting an inch or so beyond the cheek surface.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 110160]), Text sample: Grotesque, alien and terrifying, it made no hostile move.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 105600]), Text sample: And, since it had not turned its head, he could not be sure it had even sighted him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 71280]), Text sample: And was waiting-for what?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147120]), Text sample: He withdrew farther into the wood, intent upon finding a detour which would bring him out into the open lands.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 134640]), Text sample: Now he wanted to join forces with his own kind, whether those men were potential enemies or not.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 213840]), Text sample: As time passed the beasts closed about the clearing of the camp. Afternoon was fading into evening when he reached a point several miles downstream near the river.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 108240]), Text sample: He hoped they did not willingly venture out of the trees where the leaves were their protection.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 430320]), Text sample: Rynch went flat on the stream bank, made a worm's progress up the slope to crouch behind a bush and survey the land immediately ahead. There stood an off world spacer, fins down, nose skyward, and grouped not too far from its landing ramp, a collection of bubble tents.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89040]), Text sample: A fire burned in their midst and men were moving about it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 336960]), Text sample: Now that he was free from the wood and its watchers and had come so near to his goal, Rynch was curiously reluctant to do the sensible thing, to rise out of concealment and walk up to that fire, to claim rescue by his own kind.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 174480]), Text sample: The man he sought stood by the fire, shrugging his arms into a webbing harness which brought a box against his chest.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 85200]), Text sample: Having made that fast he picked up a needler by its sling.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 188880]), Text sample: By their gestures the others were arguing with him, but he shook his head, came on, to be a shadow stalking among other shadows.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 207360]), Text sample: One of the men trailed him, but as they reached a post planted a little beyond the bubble tents he stopped, allowed the explorer to advance alone into the dark.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45120]), Text sample: Rynch went to cover under a bush.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99840]), Text sample: Had they somehow learned of his own presence nearby, were they out to find him?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 25920]), Text sample: The watchers!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43440]), Text sample: Was the other out to spy on them?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35760]), Text sample: That idea made sense.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 254160]), Text sample: And in the meantime he would let the other past him, follow along behind until he was far enough from the camp so that his friends could not interfere-then, they would have a meeting!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58320]), Text sample: Rynch's fingers balled into fists.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 83280]), Text sample: That other would know, and would tell him the truth!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 141600]), Text sample: Alert as he was, he lost sight of the stranger who melted into the dusky cover of the shadows.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89760]), Text sample: The man from the spacer camp was using the stream as his road.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 186480]), Text sample: In spite of his caution Rynch was close to betrayal as he edged around a clump of vegetation growing half in, half out of the stream.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 101520]), Text sample: Only a timely rustle told him that the other had sat down on a drift log.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 21600]), Text sample: Waiting for him?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 97680]), Text sample: Rynch froze, so startled that he could not think clearly for a second.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 115200]), Text sample: Then he noted that the outline of the other's body was visible, growing brighter by the moment.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 134880]), Text sample: The dark shadow of an arm flapped, the radiance swirled, broke again into pinpoint sparks.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 154320]), Text sample: He pushed back into the bushes while the sparks still flitted, but they no longer gathered in strength enough to light his presence.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 149760]), Text sample: Now he could see they drifted about the vegetation, about the log where the man sat, about rocks and reeds.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 237839]), Text sample: He continued to keep them whirling by means of waving hand and arm, but there was enough light to show Rynch the fingers of his other hand, busy on the front panel of the box he wore.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 108719]), Text sample: That fingering stopped, then Rynch's head came up as he heard a very faint sound.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 70320]), Text sample: Not a beast's cry-or was it?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48960]), Text sample: Again those fingers moved on the panel.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58800]), Text sample: Was the other sending a message by that means?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 242401]), Text sample: Rynch watched him check the webbing, count the equipment at his belt, settle the needler in the crook of his arm. Then the stranger left the stream, headed towards the woods.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 110401]), Text sample: Rynch jumped to his feet, a cry of warning shaping, but not to be uttered.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32400]), Text sample: He padded after the other.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 124558]), Text sample: There was plenty of time to stop the man before he reached the danger which might lurk under the trees.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 132000]), Text sample: However the other was as wary of that dark as if he suspected what might lie in wait there.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 103440]), Text sample: Thankfully Rynch found his own lurking place from which he could keep the other in sight.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 124322]), Text sample: The light points gathered, hung in a small luminous cloud over the rocks.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 230159]), Text sample: But Rynch had prudently withdrawn under a bush, and the scent of its aromatic leaves must have discouraged the sparks, for no such crown came to his sentry post.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 134880]), Text sample: To open his eyes to this blue green pocket instead of to four dirty walls, was wrong.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 103440]), Text sample: Remembering, he started up and slunk down the slope, angry at his failure.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 257280]), Text sample: He found the other's track, not turning back as he had half feared, cleanly printed on level spots of wet earth-eastward now. What was the purpose of the other's expedition?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 257760]), Text sample: The man from the spacer had made no effort to conceal his trail, in fact it would almost seem that he had deliberately gone out of his way to leave boot prints on favorable stretches of ground.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 127200]), Text sample: Did he guess that Rynch lurked behind, was now leading him on for some purpose of his own?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67440]), Text sample: Or were those traces left to guide another party from the camp?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 77519]), Text sample: To advance openly up the stream bed was to invite discovery.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41040]), Text sample: Rynch surveyed the nearer bank.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 130081]), Text sample: Clumps of small trees and high growing bushes dotted that expanse, an ideal cover.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 122161]), Text sample: And the feline was attacking an enemy, enraged to the pitch of vocal frenzy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 93600]), Text sample: Rynch ran a zigzag course from one clump of bush to the next.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 176639]), Text sample: That sound of snarling, spitting hate ended in mid cry as Rynch crawled to the river bank.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 144961]), Text sample: The man from the spacer camp had been the focus of a three prong attack from a female and her cubs.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 185280]), Text sample: Three red bodies were flat and still on the gravel as the off worlder leaned back against a rock breathing heavily.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 237359]), Text sample: As Rynch sighted him, he stooped to recover the needler he had dropped, lurched away from the rock towards the water, and so blundered straight into another Jumalan trap.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 221519]), Text sample: His unsteady foot advancing for another step came down on a slippery surface, and he fell forward as his legs were engulfed in the trap burrow of a strong jaws.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 223202]), Text sample: The man eyed him steadily, and his expression did not alter even when Rynch swung the off world weapon to center its sights on the late owner.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 159120]), Text sample: "Suppose," Rynch's voice was rusty sounding in his own ears, "we talk now."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 25199]), Text sample: The man nodded.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37681]), Text sample: "As you wish, Brodie."

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 185520]), Text sample: "I know but of two that I can recommend from personal knowledge; but these two officers I can venture to pledge myself for."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 18480]), Text sample: "Any more?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147840]), Text sample: Edward went to Chaloner and Grenville, who were delighted with the intelligence which he brought them.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 97920]), Text sample: The next day they were at the prince's levee, and introduced by Edward.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 288720]), Text sample: But eventually Conde was beaten back by the superior force of Turenne; and, not receiving the assistance he expected from the Spaniards, he fell back to the frontiers of Champagne.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 281520]), Text sample: The Prince of Conde now had the command of the Spanish forces in the Netherlands; and Edward, with his friends, followed his fortunes, and gained his good will: they were rapidly promoted.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 288480]), Text sample: Turenne bore down Conde, who had gained every campaign; and the court of Spain, wearied with reverses, made overtures of peace, which was gladly accepted by the French.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 307440]), Text sample: Edward, who but rarely heard from Humphrey, was now anxious to quit the army and go to the king, who was in Spain; but to leave his colors, while things were adverse, was impossible.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 195360]), Text sample: After the peace and the pardon of Conde by the French king, the armies were disbanded, and the three adventurers were free.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20880]), Text sample: Do you recognize them?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 163441]), Text sample: "Yes," replied Grenville, "there can be no doubt of that; but will they, think you, recognize us?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 192479]), Text sample: "Is it possible," thought Edward, "that these can be the two girls in russet gowns, that I left at the cottage?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 28320]), Text sample: And yet it must be.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 114481]), Text sample: Well, Chaloner, to all appearance, your good aunts have done justice to their charge."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 36000]), Text sample: "Nature has done more, Edward.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 80400]), Text sample: As they passed, Edward caught the eye of Edith, and smiled.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 149520]), Text sample: "Alice, that's Edward!" said Edith, so loud, as to be heard by the king, and all near him.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 255359]), Text sample: We pass over the joy of this meeting after so many years' absence, and the pleasure which it gave to Edward to find his sisters grown such accomplished and elegant young women.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 224880]), Text sample: That his two friends, who were, as the reader will recollect, old acquaintances of Alice and Edith, were warmly received, we hardly need say.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 149520]), Text sample: "Now, Edward, who do you think was here to day-the reigning belle, and the toast of all the gentlemen?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 17281]), Text sample: "Indeed!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 143520]), Text sample: "No less than one with whom you were formerly well acquainted, Edward-Patience Heatherstone."

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 22800]), Text sample: "A few days back.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 108959]), Text sample: Humphrey has charge of it until it is ascertained to whom it is to belong."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 79440]), Text sample: "It belongs to mr Heatherstone, does it not?" replied Edward.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99121]), Text sample: "Yes, I did; but let us not talk about it any more, my dear Edith.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37202]), Text sample: "What is your perplexity?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 163680]), Text sample: "Well," replied Edward, "since it is to be so, let us sit down and talk over the matter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 378238]), Text sample: I acknowledge the kindness of mr Heatherstone, and feel that all he asserted to Humphrey is true: still I do not like that I should be indebted to him for a property which is mine, and that he has no right to give.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 129359]), Text sample: I acknowledge his generosity, but I do not acknowledge his right of possession.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 477360]), Text sample: Nay, much as I admire, and I may say, fond as I am (for time has not effaced the feeling) of his daughter, it still appears to me that, although not said, it is expected that she is to be included in the transfer; and I will accept no wife on such conditions."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 288000]), Text sample: "That is to say, because all you wish for, your property and a woman you love, are offered you in one lot, you will not accept them; they must be divided, and handed over to you in two!" said Alice, smiling.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 118800]), Text sample: "You mistake, dearest; I am not so foolish; but I have a certain pride, which you can not blame.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 152401]), Text sample: Accepting the property from mr Heatherstone is receiving a favor were it given as a marriage portion with his daughter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 28080]), Text sample: He can not refuse it."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74642]), Text sample: "Put not your trust in princes, brother," replied Alice.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 218160]), Text sample: Recollect also that mr Heatherstone, and his brother in law, Sir Ashley Cooper, have done the king much more service than you ever have or can do.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 173760]), Text sample: They have been most important agents in his restoration, and the king's obligations to them are much greater than they are to you.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 180481]), Text sample: At all events, Edward, recollect you do not know what are the intentions of mr Heatherstone; wait and see what he proffers first."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 93599]), Text sample: He is not going to surrender my property and make me a present of the house."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56640]), Text sample: "The reason for rebuilding the mansion was good.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 104640]), Text sample: You were at the wars; it was possible that you might, or might not return.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 124080]), Text sample: "Your advice is good, my dear Alice, and I will be guided by it," replied Edward.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 203760]), Text sample: That much of their property has been taken away and put into other hands, I know; and probably they expect it will be restored upon their application to the king.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 104642]), Text sample: Those who hold the property think so too, and so far it is fortunate.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 94080]), Text sample: Now is their time: even a few days' delay may make a difference.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 103440]), Text sample: "We must go now, and I will not fail to communicate it to them this very night."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 251041]), Text sample: We may as well here inform the reader that the advice was immediately acted upon, and that Chaloner and Grenville recovered all their estates at about five years' purchase.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49680]), Text sample: Edward remained at court several days.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 137759]), Text sample: He had written to Humphrey, and had dispatched a messenger with the letter; but the messenger had not yet returned.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 86401]), Text sample: The court was now one continual scene of fetes and gayety.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 116880]), Text sample: On the following day a drawing room was to be held, and Edward's sisters were to be presented.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 639841]), Text sample: Edward was standing, with many others of the suit, behind the chair of the king, amusing himself with the presentations as they took place, and waiting for the arrival of his sisters-Chaloner and Grenville were not with him, they had obtained leave to go into the country, for the object we have before referred to-when his eyes caught, advancing toward the king, mr Heatherstone, who led his daughter, Patience.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 422160]), Text sample: That they had not perceived him was evident; indeed her eyes were not raised once, from the natural timidity felt by a young woman in the presence of royalty. Edward half concealed himself behind one of his companions that he might gaze upon her without reserve.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 496802]), Text sample: There was the same pensive, sweet expression in her face, which had altered little; but the beautiful rounded arms, the symmetrical fall of the shoulders, and the proportion of the whole figure was a surprise to him; and Edward, in his own mind, agreed that she might well be the reigning toast of the day.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 106321]), Text sample: After he had saluted her, the king said, loud enough for Edward to hear,
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66718]), Text sample: I trust that the daughter will often grace our court."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 173760]), Text sample: Patience made no reply, but passed on; and, soon afterward, Edward lost sight of her in the crowd.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 117598]), Text sample: When he entered the room, he found himself in the arms of Humphrey, who had arrived with the messenger.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 55201]), Text sample: After the greetings were over, Edward said,
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 112559]), Text sample: "Alice and I have seen Patience, and I fear I must surrender at discretion.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 144000]), Text sample: mr Heatherstone may make his own terms; I must wave all pride rather than lose her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 207120]), Text sample: I thought that I had more control over myself; but I have seen her, and feel that my future happiness depends upon obtaining her as a wife.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 133439]), Text sample: Let her father but give me her, and Arnwood will be but a trifle in addition!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 156961]), Text sample: "With respect to the conditions upon which you are to possess Arnwood," said Humphrey, "I can inform you what they are.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 190802]), Text sample: They are wholly unshackled, further than that you are to repay by installments the money expended in the building of the house.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 273838]), Text sample: This I am empowered to state to you, and I think you will allow that mr Heatherstone has fully acted up to what he stated were his views when he first obtained a grant of the property."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48721]), Text sample: "He has, indeed," replied Edward.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 144718]), Text sample: "As for his daughter, Edward, you have yet to 'win her and wear her,' as the saying is.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 276481]), Text sample: Her father will resign the property to you as yours by right, but you have no property in his daughter, and I suspect that she will not be quite so easily handed over to you."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 50160]), Text sample: "But why should you say so, Humphrey?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53520]), Text sample: Have we not been attached from our youth?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 186721]), Text sample: "Yes, it was a youthful passion, I grant; but recollect nothing came of it, and years have passed away.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 212640]), Text sample: It is now seven years since you quitted the forest, and in your letters to mr Heatherstone you made no remark upon what had passed between you and Patience.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72721]), Text sample: "Well, my view is different," replied Edith.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 161282]), Text sample: "You know, Humphrey, how many offers Patience Heatherstone has had, and has every day, I may say.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 59760]), Text sample: "It may be so, Edith," replied Humphrey.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 61922]), Text sample: "Much you know about women," replied Edith.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 152159]), Text sample: "Very true, my dear sister; perhaps that is the reason that the New Forest has had such charms for me."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 119042]), Text sample: "After that speech, sir, the sooner you get back again the better!" retorted Edith.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74162]), Text sample: But Edward made a sign to Humphrey, and they beat a retreat.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42241]), Text sample: "Have you seen the intendant, Humphrey?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89279]), Text sample: "No; I was about to call upon him, but I wanted to see you first."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20402]), Text sample: "I will go with you.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72240]), Text sample: What must he think of my not having called upon him!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 14880]), Text sample: "Nothing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35042]), Text sample: You hold a place at court.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 127199]), Text sample: Tell him that I have just made known to you his noble and disinterested conduct."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34081]), Text sample: "You are right-I will.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 117361]), Text sample: I fear, however, Humphrey, that you are right and Edith wrong as regards his daughter."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68640]), Text sample: Edward was most kindly received by mr Heatherstone.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 225601]), Text sample: Edward, on mr Heatherstone repeating to him his intentions relative to Arnwood, expressed his sense of that gentleman's conduct, simply adding-
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 119520]), Text sample: "You may think me impetuous, sir, but I trust you will believe me grateful."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90000]), Text sample: Patience colored up and trembled when Edward first saw her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 126480]), Text sample: Edward did not refer to the past for some time after they had renewed their acquaintance.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 27838]), Text sample: Then all was explained.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 532081]), Text sample: About a year after the Restoration, there was a fete at Hampton Court, given in honor of three marriages taking place-Edward Beverley to Patience Heatherstone, Chaloner to Alice, and Grenville to Edith; and, as his majesty himself said, as he gave away the brides, "Could loyalty be better rewarded?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 209760]), Text sample: But our young readers will not be content if they do not hear some particulars about the other personages who have appeared in our little history.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43199]), Text sample: Humphrey must take the first place.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 38402]), Text sample: His love of farming continued.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 186238]), Text sample: Edward gave him a large farm, rent free; and in a few years Humphrey saved up sufficient to purchase a property for himself.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 438961]), Text sample: He then married Clara Ratcliffe, who has not appeared lately on the scene, owing to her having been, about two years before the Restoration, claimed by an elderly relation, who lived in the country, and whose infirm state of health did not permit him to quit the house.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99120]), Text sample: He left his property to Clara, about a year after her marriage to Humphrey.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 196321]), Text sample: This is all that we have been able to collect relative to the several parties; and so now we must say farewell.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99840]), Text sample: Fears in that direction have been uttered repeatedly, but from very different standpoints.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 332880]), Text sample: It is claimed that suggestive power, especially in the form of hypnotization, may be secretly misused to make anyone without his knowledge and against his will a passive instrument of the hypnotist's intent.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 73440]), Text sample: Often this is coupled with telepathic fancies.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 81120]), Text sample: All hypnotizing therefore ought to be interdicted by the state.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 222480]), Text sample: We know that hypnotism is not based on any special power of the hypnotizer; there is no magnetic fluid in the sense of the old mesmerism.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 423840]), Text sample: The imagination of the hypnotized person is the only hypnotizing agency. Thus no one can be hypnotized without his knowledge or against his will. The story of telepathic mysteries which is often brought before the public is probably always the outcome of a diseased brain.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 158400]), Text sample: But if we were to strike out all suggestive influences from social life, we should give up social life itself.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 264000]), Text sample: The good resolution and the bad one can be suggested, the good example and the bad can be effective; both encouragement of the noble and imitation of the evil may work with the same mental technique.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 270240]), Text sample: The easily suggestible person cannot be protected by any interdict; he may catch suggestions everywhere, any advertisement in the newspaper and any display in the shop window may overrun his own intentions.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67680]), Text sample: What he needs is training in firmness.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 190080]), Text sample: The application of reenforced suggestion or even of hypnotism in the doctor's office is even for him no possible source of danger.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 154320]), Text sample: On a higher level are objections which come from serious quarters and which are not without sympathy with true science.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 87600]), Text sample: In recent times this opposition has repeatedly found eloquent expression.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 277440]), Text sample: It is an objection from the standpoint of morality, belonging therefore entirely to the purposive view of the mind, but we have now reached a point where it is our duty to do justice to this purposive view too.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 193680]), Text sample: As long as we discussed the problem entirely from the standpoint of the physician, no other view of mental life except the causal one could be in question.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 128400]), Text sample: If there is moral criticism against suggestive therapy, it is the duty of the community to consider it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 207120]), Text sample: This opposition argues as follows: Hypnotic influence brings the patient under the will control of the hypnotizer and thus destroys his own freedom.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 318240]), Text sample: His achievement has therefore no moral value, and if he is really cured of his drunkenness or of his perverse habits, of his misuse of cocaine or of his criminal tendencies, he has lost the right to be counted a moral agent.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 153120]), Text sample: It would be better if there were more suffering in the world than that the existence of the moral will should be undermined.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49920]), Text sample: No one ought to take such arguments lightly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 216480]), Text sample: No one can insist too earnestly that life is worth living only if it serves moral duties and moral freedom and is not determined by pleasures and absence of pain only.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 154560]), Text sample: Those who set forth this argument are entirely willing to acknowledge the profound effect which suggestive therapeutics may create.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 443520]), Text sample: A forcible book of recent days calls the suggestive power of the psychotherapist "The Great Psychological Crime." It says to the hypnotist: "By your own testimony, you stand convicted of applying a process which deprives your subjects of the inalienable right and power of individual self control.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 203280]), Text sample: In proportion as you deprive him of the power of self control, you deprive him of that upon which his individual responsibility and moral status depend.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 209280]), Text sample: But this censure too is entirely mistaken, not because it urges the purposive views against the causal but because it is in error as to the facts.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 255840]), Text sample: Such critics are fully under the influence of the startling results which are reached; they do not take the trouble to examine the long and difficult way which has had to be traversed with patience and energy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 262800]), Text sample: It is quite true that if I hypnotize a man and suggest to him to take up after awaking the book which lies on my table, he follows my suggestion without conflict and in a certain sense without freedom.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 375120]), Text sample: He feels a simple impulse to go to the table and lift the book and, as no stronger natural desire and no moral objection stand in the way, he carries out that meaningless impulse and perhaps even invents a foolish motive to explain to himself why he wanted to look at that book.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 307200]), Text sample: But after a long experience, I have my doubts as to whether a man was ever cured in such a way by hypnotism of serious disturbances and of those anomalous actions which the critics want to see overcome by the patient's own moral efforts.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 238800]), Text sample: On the contrary, every suggestion has to rely on the efforts and struggles of the patient himself and all that the psychotherapists can give him is help in his own moral fight.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 256080]), Text sample: If again and again I hesitate to undertake new cases, it is just because I have to see during the treatment too much of this daily and hourly striving against overpowering impulses.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 250322]), Text sample: The joy of removing some obstacles from the way of the patients is too much overshadowed by the deep pity and sympathy with their suffering and craving during the whole period of successive treatments.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 214320]), Text sample: To make a man fight where despair is inevitable, and where the enemy is necessarily stronger than his own powers, can certainly not be the moral demand.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 159599]), Text sample: Morality postulates that everyone find conditions in which he can be victorious if he puts his strongest efforts to the task.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 215759]), Text sample: To make clear this purposive side of the case as against the causal one which alone interested the physician, I may add a few features to the short report as a typical example.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 149041]), Text sample: In truth it was the result of four months of the most noble and courageous suffering and struggling.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 59760]), Text sample: He had been for years a slave to his passion.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 250080]), Text sample: For the first few months, I found great relief after every injection of morphine, but soon I could not get the same easy feeling and could eat but very little and what sleep I got was in the daytime.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 194399]), Text sample: When I first went to see the professor in the Harvard Psychological Laboratory, I was using between thirty two and thirty eight grains of morphine daily.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 207839]), Text sample: He put me under his treatment october sixth and that day cut me down by hypnotic treatment to nine grains a day or three doses of three grains a day.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48000]), Text sample: The desire for the drug was something terrible.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 366961]), Text sample: But in about four days I got used to the loss of so much morphine and stayed on this amount for a week, seeing the professor every other day for hypnotic treatment and then returning to my room where I spent twenty two hours of the twenty four on the bed, but did not sleep more than two or three hours a day.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 134880]), Text sample: At the end of the week I was cut off by hypnotic suggestion half a grain and this put me to fighting the desire again.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 199680]), Text sample: The worst time of all was a cut from four injections of a fourth of a grain each to four of one eighth of a grain each, which was about january tenth.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 70322]), Text sample: At this time I had the worst two days of my life.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 142560]), Text sample: I tried whiskey, but it gave relief only for about half an hour and then the desire was worse than ever."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 397920]), Text sample: It was a moral victory when he finally reached the point at which he went for several weeks without any desire for morphine and finally presented the remaining tablets to a hospital. And yet there would not have been the least chance for his winning this ethical victory without the outer help of the hypnotist.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 118560]), Text sample: We do not eliminate the moral will but we remove some unfair obstacles from its path.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 164640]), Text sample: If that were immoral, we should have to make up our minds that all education and training were perverted with such immoral elements.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 266399]), Text sample: That is the glory of life that the suggestive power may belong to moral values instead of mere pleasures, but it is not the aim of life to remain untouched by suggestion.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 139680]), Text sample: Much more justified than such ethical objections are the fears which move entirely in the causal sphere.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 323279]), Text sample: It must be acknowledged that a method which has such powerful influence over the mind that it can secure ideas and emotions and impulses which the own will of the patient cannot produce, ought to be allowed only to those who are prepared for its skillful use.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 151919]), Text sample: To hypnotize or to perform any persistent psychotherapeutic treatment may thus be dangerous, if it is done by the unfit.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 348480]), Text sample: We have discussed before the injuries which might result from the administration of such powerful psychotherapeutic effects through the best meaning minister, but we can extend this fear to anyone who has not systematically studied medicine and to a certain degree normal and abnormal psychology.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 488880]), Text sample: The possibilities of overlooking symptoms which ought to suggest an entirely different treatment, or of adjusting the treatment badly to the special physical conditions, or of ignoring the desirable physical supplement by drugs, or of creating unintentionally by suggestion injurious effects, are always open when medical amateurs undertake such work.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 366480]), Text sample: All that involves the conviction that even the experimental psychologist as such is not prepared to enter into medical treatment; and a "Psychological Clinic," managed by a psychologist who is not a doctor of medicine, is certainly not better than a church clinic.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 149041]), Text sample: I cannot even acknowledge the right of psychologists to make hypnotic experiments merely for the psychological experiment's sake.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 196560]), Text sample: Nobody ought to be brought into a hypnotic or otherwise abnormal state of mind if it is not suggested by the interests of the subject himself.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 442560]), Text sample: Science has the right to make hypnotic experiments, or experiments with abnormal mental states, only under the one condition that a physician has hypnotized the subject in the interests of his health and that the patient has agreed beforehand to allow in the presence of witnesses certain psychological studies.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 222240]), Text sample: Needless to say that any hypnotization for mere amusement and as a parlor trick ought to be considered as criminal.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 222960]), Text sample: We spoke of the danger which the mental cures carry with them when they are based on any particular creed, and especially when they are tied up with a semi religious arbitrary metaphysics.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 277922]), Text sample: What is gained if some nervous disorders are helped by belief, if the belief itself devastates our intellectual culture and brings the masses down again to a view of the world which has all the earmarks of barbarism?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 323282]), Text sample: That is indeed one of the central dangers of all non medical suggestive cures, that while any belief may cure through the mere emotional power of the act of believing, the content of the belief gains an undeserved appearance of truth.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 165120]), Text sample: Any absurd superstition can become accredited because its curative value may be equal to a truly valuable suggestion.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 490321]), Text sample: The intellectual life of the community would have to suffer greatly if the way to be freed from bodily suffering had to be the belief in the metaphysical doctrines of mrs Eddy's "Science and Health." From a cultural viewpoint, too, suggestive therapeutics must stand the higher, the more sharply it is separated from special philosophical or religious doctrines.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 185039]), Text sample: No theory of the world and of God ought to gain authority over the mind from such an external motive as a belief in its curative effects.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 361919]), Text sample: Freest from such implications is certainly the hypnotic method of the physician who does not need the strong religious reenforcement of the suggestion because he reenforces instead the suggestibility of the patient by slight influences on his senses.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 324240]), Text sample: Even where sound religion without superstition and without pseudophilosophy stands behind the therapeutic work, the community will not give up the question whether the church does not necessarily neglect by it the interests which are superior.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 187441]), Text sample: The community becomes more and more strongly aware that too many factors of our modern society urge the church to undertake non religious work.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 149042]), Text sample: Social aid and charity work ought to be filled with religious spirit, but to perform it is not itself religion.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 304562]), Text sample: Still more that is true of the healing of the sick. Whether or not such expansion of church activity in different directions saps the vital strength of religion itself is indeed a problem for the whole community.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 522240]), Text sample: The fear suggests itself that the spiritual achievement may become hampered, that in the competition of the church with the other agencies of social life the particular church task may be pushed to the background, and that thus the church in imitating that which others can do just as well or better loses the power to do that which the church alone can do.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 305282]), Text sample: From whatever starting point we may come, we are led to the conviction that the physician alone is called to administer psychotherapeutic work, but that he needs a thorough psychological training besides his medical one.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 268321]), Text sample: Both educators and criminologists have indeed often raised such questions, and social reformers have not seldom seen there wide perspectives for social movements in future times.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 172562]), Text sample: When we spoke of the treatment of the sick, we had always to emphasize that the suggestion cures symptoms but not diseases.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 271201]), Text sample: Yes, the artificial reenforcement of such special features would deprive education of that which is the most essential, namely, the development of the power to overcome difficulties by own energy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 234961]), Text sample: Wherever a reasonable amount of own will force and attention can be expected to overcome the antagonistic influence, there artificial hypnotic influence ought to be avoided.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 205922]), Text sample: Everything ought to be left in that case to suggestions within normal limits, in the form of good example and persuasions, authority and discipline, love and sympathy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 169201]), Text sample: That holds true even for very slight abnormalities which seem still within the limits where the own energies can bring about the cure.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 269280]), Text sample: For instance, I have steadily refused requests of students and others to use hypnotism for the purpose of overcoming merely bad habits, such as the habit of biting the nails.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 288480]), Text sample: A child who finds some difficulty in sticking seriously to his tasks might learn now this and now that under the influence of hypnotic suggestions but he would remain entirely untrained for mastering the next lesson.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63838]), Text sample: Still more complex is the criminological problem.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 263039]), Text sample: And if the absurdity of such a proposal is recognized it seems to many justified to demand such an intrusion at least in the case of the born criminal, even if the occasional criminal cannot be reached.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 150481]), Text sample: The varieties which nature really produces are brains which are more liable than others to produce antisocial actions.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 193201]), Text sample: We recognized from the start that the abnormal mind never introduces any new elements but is characterized only by a change of proportions.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 235442]), Text sample: There is too much or too little of a certain mental process and just for that reason there must be a steady and continuous transition from the normal to the entirely abnormal.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 234478]), Text sample: Here again we have not a special class of brains which are criminal; but we have an endless variety of brains with a greater or smaller predisposition for antisocial outbreaks.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 121682]), Text sample: The variations which produce this criminal effect may lie in most different directions.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 222481]), Text sample: The fact that selfish and thus antisocial desires awake in the mind is not abnormal at all; only if they are not normally inhibited, the disturbance sets in.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 206640]), Text sample: Furthermore the associative apparatus of the brain may work especially slowly; it may thus bring it about that the counteracting ideas do not arise in time.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 152159]), Text sample: Or there may be negative suggestibility, by which a moral admonition stirs up a vivid idea of the opposite.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 267838]), Text sample: In short, there may be a large number of factors, sometimes even in combination, each one of which increases the chances that the individual may come in danger in the midst of developed society.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 40559]), Text sample: No character is perfect.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 330718]), Text sample: All that society can do is, therefore, not to remodel the manifoldness of brains, but to shape the conditions of life in such a way that the weak and unstable brains also have a greater chance to live their lives without conflicts with the community.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 185760]), Text sample: The situation is different as soon as the particular surroundings have brought it about that such a brain with reduced powers has entered a criminal career.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 103441]), Text sample: The thought of crime now becomes a sort of obsession or rather an autosuggestion.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 200159]), Text sample: If such cases should come early to suggestive treatment which really would close the channels of the antisocial autosuggestion, much harm might be averted.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 278642]), Text sample: Yet again the liability of the brain to become antisocial would not have been removed, and thus not much would be secured unless such a person after the treatment could be kept under favorable conditions.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 320880]), Text sample: With young boys who through unfortunate influence have caught a tendency, for instance, to steal, and where the fault does not yield to sympathetic reasoning and to punishment, an early hypnotic treatment might certainly be tried.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48720]), Text sample: I myself have seen promising results.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 298799]), Text sample: But if the impulse has irresistible character in such a way that the good will is powerless, we are again in the field of disease and the point of view of the physician has to be substituted for that of the criminologist.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 158880]), Text sample: Whether pedagogy and criminology are to make use of the services of psychotherapy is thus certainly an open question.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 187439]), Text sample: The artificial over suggestions which are needed to overcome the pathological disturbances of mental equilibrium may be left for the cases of illness.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 285120]), Text sample: To reduce these abnormalities means to secure a more stable equilibrium and thus to avoid social damages, and at the same time to prevent the growth of the abnormality to pathological dimensions.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 218400]), Text sample: To counteract these slighter variations, these abnormalities which have not yet reached the degree of disease, will demand the same principles of treatment, only in a weaker form.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 110880]), Text sample: It is in a way not psychical therapy but psychical hygiene.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 439679]), Text sample: And this is no longer confined to the physician but must be intrusted to all organs of the community. And here more than in the case of disease, the causal point of view of the physician ought to be brought into harmony with the purposive view of the social reformer, of the educator and of the moralist.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 172562]), Text sample: The ideal of such mental hygiene is the complete equilibrium of all mental energies together with their fullest possible development.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 351121]), Text sample: To work towards this end does not mean to aim towards the impossible and undesirable end of making all men alike, but to give to all, in spite of the differences which nature and society condition, the greatest possible inner completeness and outer usefulness.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 295442]), Text sample: The efforts in that direction have to begin with the earliest infancy and are at no age to be considered as finished; the whole school work and to a high degree the professional work has to be subordinated to such endeavor.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 401042]), Text sample: Society has further to take care that those spheres of life which stand less under systematic principles, such as the home life of the child and the social life of the man, his family life and his public life, are steadily under the pressure of influences which urge in the same direction.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 178801]), Text sample: Harmonious development without one sidedness, and yet with full justice to the individual talents and equipments, should be secured.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 152160]), Text sample: That means from the start an effort to secure balance between general education and particular development.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 184802]), Text sample: The latter has to strengthen those powers by which the boy or girl by special natural fitness promises to be especially efficient and happy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 253199]), Text sample: More important, it would leave undeveloped that power which the youth especially needs to acquire by serious education, the power to master what does not appeal to the personal likings and interests.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 225358]), Text sample: An equilibrium is secured only if at the same time full emphasis is given to the learning and training in all which is the common ground of our social existence.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 331201]), Text sample: From the multiplication table to the highest cultural studies in college, the youth is to be adjusted to the material of our civilization without any concession to the emasculating desire to adjust civilization simply to the particular youth.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 294000]), Text sample: He has to learn learning and not only to play with knowledge, he has to learn to force his attention in adjustment to those factors of civilization which are foreign to his personal tendencies and perhaps unsympathetic.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 166802]), Text sample: Free election of life's work and unyielding mental discipline in the service of the common demands should thus steadily cooeperate.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 160319]), Text sample: The one without the other creates a lack of mental balance which is the most favorable condition for a pathological disturbance.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 128639]), Text sample: The mere learning is of course on both sides only a fraction of what the community has to develop in the youth.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 225361]), Text sample: The nourishment of the child, the care for the child's sense organs, the recesses and the rest from fatigue, and especially the undisturbed sleep are essential conditions.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 202081]), Text sample: It must not be forgotten that the decomposition of the brain molecules can never be restituted by anything but rest, and ultimately by sleep.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65279]), Text sample: Physical exercise is certainly not such restitution.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 116159]), Text sample: In the best case it brings a certain rest to some brain centers by engaging other brain parts.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 135838]), Text sample: The child needs sleep and fresh air and healthful food more than anything else, if his mind is active.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 203760]), Text sample: More important than mere physical hygiene is the demand that a sound character and a sound temperament are also to be built up, at the side of a sound interest.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 159841]), Text sample: The emotional stability and emotional enlargement of the mind is perhaps most neglected in our educational schemes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 165120]), Text sample: On the one side it demands a systematic discipline of the emotions, on the other a healthy stimulation of emotions.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 175198]), Text sample: Destructive emotions like terror ought to be kept away and not needlessly brought near by uncanny stories and mystic superstitions.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 443279]), Text sample: Again in the field of will, we want the strong, spontaneous, independent will which is not frightened by discomfort and not discouraged by obstacles, and yet we want the will which is not stubborn and selfish but which subordinates itself to the larger will of the social group and to the eternal will of the norm.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 168000]), Text sample: The whole social life must shape itself in such a way that everyone finds the best possible chances to perfect this harmonious growth.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 257520]), Text sample: In the field of the intellect, the community must take care that thoroughness of training and accuracy of information is rigidly demanded and not thrust out by an easy going superficiality.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 281760]), Text sample: Yet while thoroughness demands concentration in one direction, society must with the same earnestness insist on well rounded general education and continuity of general interests through life.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 267598]), Text sample: Literature and the libraries, the newspapers and the magazines play there a foremost role, and again the mental health of the community has to pay the penalty if its newspapers work against general culture.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 371039]), Text sample: But with this enrichment of feelings the disciplinary influence too has to go through the whole social life. Where art is sensational and the church hysterical,--in short, where the community stirs up overstrong feelings,--the wholesome balance is lost again.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 106559]), Text sample: Few factors are more influential in all these directions than the administration of law.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 203039]), Text sample: Sound sober lawmaking and fair judgment in court secure to the community a feeling of safety which gives stability to emotions and feelings.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 125039]), Text sample: A similar unbalancing influence emanates from overstrong contrasts of poverty and comfort.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 226558]), Text sample: There is no doubt the arbitrary suppression of the sexual instinct must be acknowledged as the source of nervous injury while indulgence may lead to disease and misery.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 117838]), Text sample: Not less difficult and not less connected with the mental hygiene is the alcohol problem.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 606955]), Text sample: Its intemperate use or its use by young people and by pathological persons is one of the gravest dangers. Whether intemperance ought to be fought by prohibition or rather by an education to temperance is a difficult question in which the enthusiastic women and ministers, backed by the well justified fears of psychiatrists, will hardly be on the same side as the sober judgment of scientists, unprejudiced physicians, and historians.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 188877]), Text sample: In any case the saloon and its humiliating indecency must disappear and every temptation to intemperance should be removed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 318961]), Text sample: Above all, from early childhood the self control has to be strengthened, the child has to learn from the beginning to know the limits to the gratification of his desires and to abstain from reckless over indulgence.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 129598]), Text sample: With such a training later on even the temptations of alcoholic beverages would lose their danger.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89280]), Text sample: Not less injurious than the strong drinks are the cards.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 160799]), Text sample: All gambling from the child's play to the stock exchange is ruinous for the psychophysical equilibrium.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 240721]), Text sample: The same is true of any overuse of coffee and tea and tobacco, and as a matter of course still more the habitual use of the drugs like the popular headache powders and sleeping medicines.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 162955]), Text sample: The life at home and in public ought to be manifold and expansive but ought to avoid over excitement and over anxiety.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 325201]), Text sample: A good conscience, a congenial home, and a serious purpose are after all the safest conditions for a healthy mind, and the community works in preventive psychotherapy wherever it facilitates the securing of these three factors.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 161039]), Text sample: For that end society may take over directly from the workshop of the psychotherapist quite a number of almost technical methods.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 503279]), Text sample: No one can measure the injury done to the psychophysical balance of the weaker brains, for instance, by the sensational court gossip and reports of murder trials in the newspapers for the masses. But while the influence of suggestion is on the whole familiar to public opinion, the community is much less aware of another factor which we found important in the hands of the psychotherapist.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 143760]), Text sample: We recognized that mental disturbances were often the result of suppressed emotion and repressed wishes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 103675]), Text sample: For the cure the psychotherapist has to aim toward the cathartic result.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 375597]), Text sample: The suppressed ideas had to be brought to consciousness again and then to be discharged through vivid expression. Society ought to learn from it that few factors are more disturbing for the mental balance than feelings and emotions which do not come to a normal expression.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 298318]), Text sample: It is no chance that in countries of mixed Protestant and Catholic civilization, the number of suicides is larger in Protestant regions than in the Catholic ones where the confessional relieves the suppressed emotions of the masses.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 191279]), Text sample: This is also the most destructive effect of social and legal injustice; emotions are strangulated and then begin to work mischief.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 219358]), Text sample: The community should take care early that secret feelings are avoided, that the child is cured from all sullenness which stores up the emotion instead of discharging it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 196799]), Text sample: All life becomes a psychophysical mechanism and from that point of view man's thinking and acting become the necessary outcome of the foregoing conditions.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 101279]), Text sample: Nothing seems more unfit to give a deeper meaning to life and a higher value.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 395279]), Text sample: And yet if there was one thought which controlled our discussion from the beginning, it was certainly the conviction that this causal view itself is only an instrument in the service of idealistic endeavors; the reality of man's life is the reality of will and freedom directed towards ideals.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 202798]), Text sample: In the service of our ideals we may thus transform the world into a mechanism: out of our freedom we desire to conceive ourselves as necessary products.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 560877]), Text sample: Whenever we aim to produce changes in the world, we must calculate the effects through the means of this causal construction, but we never have a right to forget that this calculation itself is therefore only a tool and that our reality, in which our duties and our real aims lie, is itself outside of this construction. The psychotherapist wants to produce effects inasmuch as he wants to cure disease.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23520]), Text sample: THE AWAKENING
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33600]), Text sample: An awakening came.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56160]), Text sample: What a wonderfully complex thing!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 689520]), Text sample: this simple seeming unity-the self! Who can trace its reintegration as morning after morning we awaken, the flux and confluence of its countless factors interweaving, rebuilding, the dim first stirrings of the soul, the growth and synthesis of the unconscious to the subconscious, the subconscious to dawning consciousness, until at last we recognise ourselves again.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 172560]), Text sample: And as it happens to most of us after the night's sleep, so it was with Graham at the end of his vast slumber.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 265920]), Text sample: A dim cloud of sensation taking shape, a cloudy dreariness, and he found himself vaguely somewhere, recumbent, faint, but alive.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 179760]), Text sample: The pilgrimage towards a personal being seemed to traverse vast gulfs, to occupy epochs.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 289200]), Text sample: Gigantic dreams that were terrible realities at the time, left vague perplexing memories, strange creatures, strange scenery, as if from another planet.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 553200]), Text sample: There was a distinct impression, too, of a momentous conversation, of a name-he could not tell what name-that was subsequently to recur, of some queer long forgotten sensation of vein and muscle, of a feeling of vast hopeless effort, the effort of a man near drowning in darkness.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 128880]), Text sample: Then came a panorama of dazzling unstable confluent scenes....
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 142080]), Text sample: Graham became aware that his eyes were open and regarding some unfamiliar thing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 113760]), Text sample: It was something white, the edge of something, a frame of wood.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 105600]), Text sample: He moved his head slightly, following the contour of this shape.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63120]), Text sample: It went up beyond the top of his eyes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53040]), Text sample: He tried to think where he might be.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64800]), Text sample: Did it matter, seeing he was so wretched?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 76320]), Text sample: The colour of his thoughts was a dark depression.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 120720]), Text sample: He felt the featureless misery of one who wakes towards the hour of dawn.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 122640]), Text sample: He had an uncertain sense of whispers and footsteps hastily receding.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 123600]), Text sample: The movement of his head involved a perception of extreme physical weakness.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 165840]), Text sample: He supposed he was in bed in the hotel at the place in the valley-but he could not recall that white edge.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32880]), Text sample: He must have slept.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 69360]), Text sample: He remembered now that he had wanted to sleep.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 185040]), Text sample: He recalled the cliff and Waterfall again, and then recollected something about talking to a passer by....
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41520]), Text sample: How long had he slept?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56880]), Text sample: What was that sound of pattering feet?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 103680]), Text sample: And that rise and fall, like the murmur of breakers on pebbles?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 238320]), Text sample: He put out a languid hand to reach his watch from the chair whereon it was his habit to place it, and touched some smooth hard surface like glass.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99120]), Text sample: This was so unexpected that it startled him extremely.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 143760]), Text sample: Quite suddenly he rolled over, stared for a moment, and struggled into a sitting position.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 160080]), Text sample: The effort was unexpectedly difficult, and it left him giddy and weak-and amazed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34800]), Text sample: He rubbed his eyes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 201120]), Text sample: The riddle of his surroundings was confusing but his mind was quite clear-evidently his sleep had benefited him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 235200]), Text sample: He was not in a bed at all as he understood the word, but lying naked on a very soft and yielding mattress, in a trough of dark glass.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 236880]), Text sample: The mattress was partly transparent, a fact he observed with a sense of insecurity, and below it was a mirror reflecting him greyly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 361680]), Text sample: About his arm-and he saw with a shock that his skin was strangely dry and yellow-was bound a curious apparatus of rubber, bound so cunningly that it seemed to pass into his skin above and below.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 235920]), Text sample: And this bed was placed in a case of greenish coloured glass (as it seemed to him), a bar in the white framework of which had first arrested his attention.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 298080]), Text sample: In the corner of the case was a stand of glittering and delicately made apparatus, for the most part quite strange appliances, though a maximum and minimum thermometer was recognisable.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 419040]), Text sample: The slightly greenish tint of the glass like substance which surrounded him on every hand obscured what lay behind, but he perceived it was a vast apartment of splendid appearance, and with a very large and simple white archway facing him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 430560]), Text sample: Close to the walls of the cage were articles of furniture, a table covered with a silvery cloth, silvery like the side of a fish, a couple of graceful chairs, and on the table a number of dishes with substances piled on them, a bottle and two glasses.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 76800]), Text sample: He realised that he was intensely hungry.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 251040]), Text sample: He could see no one, and after a period of hesitation scrambled off the translucent mattress and tried to stand on the clean white floor of his little apartment.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 202800]), Text sample: He had miscalculated his strength, however, and staggered and put his hand against the glass like pane before him to steady himself.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 267600]), Text sample: For a moment it resisted his hand, bending outward like a distended bladder, then it broke with a slight report and vanished-a pricked bubble.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 117360]), Text sample: He reeled out into the general space of the hall, greatly astonished.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 252720]), Text sample: He caught at the table to save himself, knocking one of the glasses to the floor-it rang but did not break-and sat down in one of the armchairs.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 367440]), Text sample: When he had a little recovered he filled the remaining glass from the bottle and drank-a colourless liquid it was, but not water, with a pleasing faint aroma and taste and a quality of immediate support and stimulus.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 62640]), Text sample: He put down the vessel and looked about him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 174000]), Text sample: The apartment lost none of its size and magnificence now that the greenish transparency that had intervened was removed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 254640]), Text sample: The archway he saw led to a flight of steps, going downward without the intermediation of a door, to a spacious transverse passage.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 371520]), Text sample: This passage ran between polished pillars of some white veined substance of deep ultramarine, and along it came the sound of human movements, and voices and a deep undeviating droning note.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 152640]), Text sample: He sat, now fully awake, listening alertly, forgetting the viands in his attention.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 229680]), Text sample: Then with a shock he remembered that he was naked, and casting about him for covering, saw a long black robe thrown on one of the chairs beside him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89280]), Text sample: This he wrapped about him and sat down again, trembling.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72720]), Text sample: His mind was still a surging perplexity.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90240]), Text sample: Clearly he had slept, and had been removed in his sleep.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 19200]), Text sample: But where?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 122880]), Text sample: And who were those people, the distant crowd beyond the deep blue pillars?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 25920]), Text sample: Boscastle?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 110161]), Text sample: He poured out and partially drank another glass of the colourless fluid.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 164401]), Text sample: What was this place?--this place that to his senses seemed subtly quivering like a thing alive?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 483599]), Text sample: He looked about him at the clean and beautiful form of the apartment, unstained by ornament, and saw that the roof was broken in one place by a circular shaft full of light, and, as he looked, a steady, sweeping shadow blotted it out and passed, and came again and passed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 173040]), Text sample: "Beat, beat," that sweeping shadow had a note of its own in the subdued tumult that filled the air.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 283440]), Text sample: He would have called out, but only a little sound came into his throat. Then he stood up, and, with the uncertain steps of a drunkard, made his way towards the archway.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 229920]), Text sample: He staggered down the steps, tripped on the corner of the black cloak he had wrapped about himself, and saved himself by catching at one of the blue pillars.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 381599]), Text sample: The passage ran down a cool vista of blue and purple and ended remotely in a railed space like a balcony brightly lit and projecting into a space of haze, a space like the interior of some gigantic building.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 113039]), Text sample: Beyond and remote were vast and vague architectural forms.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 426240]), Text sample: The tumult of voices rose now loud and clear, and on the balcony and with their backs to him, gesticulating and apparently in animated conversation, were three figures, richly dressed in loose and easy garments of bright soft colourings.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 426000]), Text sample: The noise of a great multitude of people poured up over the balcony, and once it seemed the top of a banner passed, and once some brightly coloured object, a pale blue cap or garment thrown up into the air perhaps, flashed athwart the space and fell.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 124800]), Text sample: The shouts sounded like English, there was a reiteration of "Wake!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 160800]), Text sample: He heard some indistinct shrill cry, and abruptly these three men began laughing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 87601]), Text sample: He turned his eyes full of merriment along the passage.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 113039]), Text sample: The other two turned swiftly at his exclamation and stood motionless.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 163440]), Text sample: Their faces assumed an expression of consternation, an expression that deepened into awe.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 243599]), Text sample: Suddenly Graham's knees bent beneath him, his arm against the pillar collapsed limply, he staggered forward and fell upon his face.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 59760]), Text sample: Fastidious correctness of form
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67920]), Text sample: Full of ardent affection and gratitude
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 71280]), Text sample: Guilty and baffled antagonists
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147840]), Text sample: He poured bitter and biting ridicule on his discomfited opponents
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68880]), Text sample: High and undiscouraged hope
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 94560]), Text sample: His mood was one of pure exaltation
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24960]), Text sample: CHAPTER nine
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 349440]), Text sample: At dinner it was announced that the famous Tarantella would be danced in the lower hall of the hotel at nine o'clock, and the girls told Uncle john that they must not miss this famous sight, which is one of the most unique in Sorrento, or indeed in all Italy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 136560]), Text sample: As they entered the pretty, circular hall devoted to the dance Louise gave a start of surprise.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 362400]), Text sample: A goodly audience had already assembled in the room, and among them the girl seemed to recognize an acquaintance, for after a brief hesitation she advanced and placed her hand in that of a gentleman who had risen on her entrance and hastened toward her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 138000]), Text sample: He was a nice looking young fellow, Beth thought, and had a foreign and quite distinguished air.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 350160]), Text sample: Presently Louise turned with cheeks somewhat flushed and brought the gentleman to her party, introducing him to Uncle john and her cousins as Count Ferralti, whom she had once met in New York while he was on a visit to America.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 183840]), Text sample: The Count twirled his small and slender moustaches in a way that Patsy thought affected, and said in excellent English:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 81360]), Text sample: "It delights me to meet mr Merrick and the young ladies.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 105120]), Text sample: May I express a hope that you are pleased with my beautiful country?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 101040]), Text sample: "Are you Italian?" asked Uncle john, regarding the young man critically.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 31200]), Text sample: "Surely, mr Merrick.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 158160]), Text sample: But I have resided much in New York, and may well claim to be an adopted son of your great city."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78960]), Text sample: "New York adopts a good many," said Uncle john, drily.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 73200]), Text sample: "It has even been thoughtless enough to adopt me."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 186240]), Text sample: The dancers entered at that moment and the Americans were forced to seat themselves hastily so as not to obstruct the view of others.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 307920]), Text sample: The dances were unique and graceful, being executed by a troup of laughing peasants dressed in native costume, who seemed very proud of their accomplishment and anxious to please the throng of tourists present.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 168240]), Text sample: The Tarantella originated in Ischia, but Sorrento and Capri have the best dancers.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 273600]), Text sample: Afterward Uncle john and his nieces stood upon the terrace and watched the volcano rolling its dense clouds, mingled with sparks of red hot scoria, toward the sky.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 135120]), Text sample: The Count clung to Louise's side, but also tried to make himself agreeable to her cousins.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 342480]), Text sample: In their rooms that night Patsy told Beth that the young foreigner was "too highfalutin' to suit her," and Beth replied that his manners were so like those of their Cousin Louise that the two ought to get along nicely together.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 333360]), Text sample: Uncle john liked his nieces to make friends, and encouraged young men generally to meet them; but there was something in the appearance of this callow Italian nobleman that stamped his character as artificial and insincere.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 201360]), Text sample: He resolved to find out something about his antecedents before he permitted the young fellow to establish friendly relations with his girls.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 222480]), Text sample: That gave him an excuse to talk with the man, who spoke very good English and was exceedingly courteous to his guests-especially when they were American.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24720]), Text sample: "Whom, sir?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 62640]), Text sample: "Ferralti-Count Ferralti.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 96720]), Text sample: "I-I did not know," he said, hesitatingly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 95280]), Text sample: "The gentleman arrived last evening, and I had not yet learned his name.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 292080]), Text sample: Let me see," he turned to his list of guests, who register by card and not in a book, and continued: "Ah, yes; he has given his name as Ferralti, but added no title.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39360]), Text sample: A count, did you say?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42480]), Text sample: "Yes," replied Uncle john.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 158880]), Text sample: Then he remarked that the eruption of Vesuvius was waning and the trouble nearly over for this time.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 61200]), Text sample: "That I cannot tell you, Signor Merrick."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 94080]), Text sample: "Oh. Perhaps you know little about the nobility of your country."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 15120]), Text sample: "I!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99120]), Text sample: I know little of the nobility!" answered Floriano, indignantly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 69840]), Text sample: "Yet you say you don't know the Ferralti family."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 80400]), Text sample: The proprietor reached for a book that lay above his desk.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 61200]), Text sample: Here is our record of nobility.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 97440]), Text sample: It is the same as the 'Blue Book' or the 'Peerage' of England.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 163440]), Text sample: Either fortunately or unfortunately-I cannot say-you have no need of such a book in America."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 85680]), Text sample: He turned the pages and ran his finger down the line of "f's."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 96720]), Text sample: "Find me, if you can, a Count Ferralti in the list."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51360]), Text sample: He put on his glasses and looked again.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 77280]), Text sample: The name of Ferralti was no place in the record.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 84000]), Text sample: Uncle john whistled softly and walked away to the window.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64800]), Text sample: The young man greeted him with a smile and a bow.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67200]), Text sample: "I misunderstood your name last evening," he said.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 50160]), Text sample: "I thought you were Count Ferralti."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68640]), Text sample: "And that is right, sir," was the prompt reply.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51120]), Text sample: "Allow me to offer you my card."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 50880]), Text sample: Uncle john took the card and read:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64080]), Text sample: He carefully placed the card in his pocket book.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 39360]), Text sample: Uncle john walked away.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 83280]), Text sample: He was glad that he had not suspected the young man unjustly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 94320]), Text sample: When an imposture is unmasked it is no longer dangerous.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 138720]), Text sample: He joined his nieces, who were all busily engaged in writing letters home, and remarked, casually:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 75360]), Text sample: "You've been deceived in your Italian friend, Louise.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 238320]), Text sample: He is neither a count nor of noble family, although I suppose when you met him in New York he had an object in posing as a titled aristocrat."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 89280]), Text sample: The girl paused, examining the point of her pen thoughtfully.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49920]), Text sample: "Are you sure, Uncle john?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 36960]), Text sample: "Quite sure, my dear.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 111120]), Text sample: I've just been through the list of Italian counts, and his name is not there.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 151200]), Text sample: Floriano, the proprietor, who knows every aristocrat in Italy, has never before heard of him."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 68880]), Text sample: "I wonder why he has tried to deceive us."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 154080]), Text sample: "Oh, the world is full of impostors; but when you are on to their game they are quite harmless.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 77040]), Text sample: Of course we won't encourage this young man in any way.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42960]), Text sample: It will be better to avoid him."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 122160]), Text sample: "He-he seems very nice and gentlemanly," said Louise with hesitation.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82800]), Text sample: The other girls exchanged glances, but made no remark.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66000]), Text sample: Uncle john hardly knew what to say further.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 360000]), Text sample: He felt he was in an awkward position, for Louise was the most experienced in worldly ways of his three nieces and he had no desire to pose as a stern guardian or to deprive his girls of any passing pleasure they might enjoy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 375840]), Text sample: Moreover, Louise being in love with that young Weldon her mother so strongly objected to, she would not be likely to care much for this Italian fellow, and mrs Merrick had enjoined him to keep her daughter's mind from dwelling on her "entanglement."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 100080]), Text sample: "Oh, well, my dear," he said to her, "you must act as you see fit.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 336480]), Text sample: I do not imagine we shall see much of this young man, in any event, and now that you are well aware of the fact that he is sailing under false colors, you will know how to handle him better than I can advise you."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 126241]), Text sample: "Well then, girls, what do you say to a stroll around the village?" asked their uncle.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 120960]), Text sample: "I'm told it's a proper place to buy silk stockings and inlaid wood work.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51839]), Text sample: They come assorted, I suppose."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 486240]), Text sample: Beth and Patsy jumped up with alacrity, but Louise pleaded that she had several more letters to write; so the others left her and passed the rest of the forenoon in rummaging among the quaint shops of Sorrento, staring at the statue of Tasso, and enjoying the street scenes so vividly opposed to those of America.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 101281]), Text sample: It was almost their first glimpse of foreign manners and customs.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64800]), Text sample: They both expected her to make trouble but were mistaken.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49199]), Text sample: First there was the old thing in him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48240]), Text sample: Instead he prayed for it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51599]), Text sample: As he talked his left eyelid twitched.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 94560]), Text sample: When he awoke at dawn the barnyard back of the house also awoke.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42000]), Text sample: In the house people stirred about.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 236400]), Text sample: "Four, five, six, seven," he said slowly, wetting his finger and making straight up and down marks on the window ledge.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 167522]), Text sample: "See, come here and look," cried the old man. "Grandfather Jesse's white mare has torn the black stocking she wears on her foot."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 25922]), Text sample: "Wake up, little animal.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 76081]), Text sample: "Make a sign to me, God," he cried.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 22799]), Text sample: "Take me away.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 230400]), Text sample: "The hand is not necessary," answered Nicholl, not at all confounded; "and as to the stone, let us suppose it to be a comet."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 212160]), Text sample: "I think that we can answer," said Barbicane; "but according to my idea the question ought not to be put in that form.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35520]), Text sample: I ask it to be put differently."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53520]), Text sample: "Here it is," continued Barbicane.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 91680]), Text sample: "And I answer in the negative," continued Barbicane.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46080]), Text sample: "Without a doubt!" answered Nicholl.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 174960]), Text sample: There remains but one hypothesis, that of a living race to which motion, which is life, is foreign."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 123600]), Text sample: "Just so," said Barbicane, "which for us has no meaning."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 140400]), Text sample: "Now," said Nicholl, "let us attack the second question, an indispensable complement of the first.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 205920]), Text sample: I ask the honorable commission, if the moon is not habitable, has she ever been inhabited, Citizen Barbicane?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 123118]), Text sample: The actual state of this cracked, twisted, and burst disc abundantly proves this.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43681]), Text sample: "I believe it," said Nicholl.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 88801]), Text sample: "At the terrestrial poles they last six months," said Michel.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60720]), Text sample: "And why?" asked Nicholl quickly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57118]), Text sample: Barbicane sought to restrain them.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24961]), Text sample: "By cooling?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 30479]), Text sample: "Most probably."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 18720]), Text sample: "But when?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 16800]), Text sample: "Certainly."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 13680]), Text sample: nine.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65520]), Text sample: It was, in fact, the princess laughing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 103200]), Text sample: "You naughty, naughty, NAUGHTY, NAUGHTY man!" she cried.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 31680]), Text sample: "I'll tell papa."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 31440]), Text sample: I pity you."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37920]), Text sample: "Put me up directly."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 40800]), Text sample: "Come, then," said the prince.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 144720]), Text sample: "How am I to put you in?" "That is your business," she answered, quite snappishly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48960]), Text sample: "You took me out-put me in again."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 141120]), Text sample: "Very well," said the prince; and, catching her up in his arms, he sprang with her from the rock.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64080]), Text sample: "Is that what you call FALLING IN?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 114720]), Text sample: The princess did not appear to understand him, for she retorted his question:--
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 17521]), Text sample: "Thank you.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 22560]), Text sample: But I don't care.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 224159]), Text sample: "I wish I hadn't one either," rejoined the princess; "it is so stupid! I have a great mind," she continued, "to play them all a trick.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 92640]), Text sample: She did not care who the man was; that was nothing to her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 91200]), Text sample: When she saw it she shrieked, and covered her face with her hands.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 114240]), Text sample: They bore her across to the stone where they had already placed a little boat for her.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52080]), Text sample: In a few minutes the prince appeared.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42720]), Text sample: "Here I am," said the prince.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20640]), Text sample: "Put me in."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20160]), Text sample: Put me in."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24480]), Text sample: "Now you can go."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 40080]), Text sample: "Princess!" said he.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23520]), Text sample: I'm afloat!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 54480]), Text sample: And the little boat bumped against the stone.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 70800]), Text sample: "Well?" said she, without looking round.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 77040]), Text sample: "There, then," said she, holding out the wine to him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34080]), Text sample: But the prince felt better.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90240]), Text sample: You must sit and look at me, else I shall not be able to keep up."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 69361]), Text sample: The princess gave a shriek, and sprang into the lake.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23040]), Text sample: THE CONCLUSION.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52800]), Text sample: "Hold your tongue," answered the Dervish.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23040]), Text sample: You know----"

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20640]), Text sample: It is enough."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 169920]), Text sample: Slowly and reluctantly yielding to the necessity, he quitted the place, and mingled with the throng that hovered nigh.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 183120]), Text sample: A knot of warriors soon entered the place again, and reissuing, they bore the senseless remains into the adjacent woods.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 215280]), Text sample: Though the return of Duncan was likely to remind them of his character, and the suspicious circumstances of his visit, it produced no visible sensation.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 430560]), Text sample: Without seeming to hesitate, he walked into the lodge, and took his seat with a gravity that accorded admirably with the deportment of his hosts. A hasty but searching glance sufficed to tell him that, though Uncas still remained where he had left him, David had not reappeared.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 302160]), Text sample: No other restraint was imposed on the former than the watchful looks of a young Huron, who had placed himself at hand; though an armed warrior leaned against the post that formed one side of the narrow doorway.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 193200]), Text sample: He would greatly have preferred silence and meditation to speech, when a discovery of his real condition might prove so instantly fatal.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 132480]), Text sample: Unfortunately for this prudent resolution, his entertainers appeared otherwise disposed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 217440]), Text sample: He had not long occupied the seat wisely taken a little in the shade, when another of the elder warriors, who spoke the French language, addressed him:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 117600]), Text sample: "My Canada father does not forget his children," said the chief; "I thank him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56400]), Text sample: Can the cunning stranger frighten him away?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 137040]), Text sample: "Spirits differ; some yield to the power of wisdom, while others are too strong."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 113760]), Text sample: "My brother is a great medicine," said the cunning savage; "he will try?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49680]), Text sample: A gesture of assent was the answer.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 165600]), Text sample: The Huron was content with the assurance, and, resuming his pipe, he awaited the proper moment to move.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 209040]), Text sample: The latter cast an impatient look at his neighbor, and felt his flesh creep with uncontrollable horror when he found himself in actual contact with Magua.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 121680]), Text sample: The sudden return of this artful and dreaded chief caused a delay in the departure of the Huron.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 84720]), Text sample: "Let 'Reed that bends' go on the hunting path; he will meet them."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 221762]), Text sample: The former was rather depressed, than remarkable for the bearing of the natives; and the latter was such as was commonly worn by the ordinary men of the nation.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 109920]), Text sample: "The Delawares have been like bears after the honey pots, prowling around my village.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48719]), Text sample: But who has ever found a Huron asleep?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 192961]), Text sample: The darkness of the impending cloud which precedes a burst of thunder was not blacker than the brow of Magua as he exclaimed:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 36959]), Text sample: "The Delawares of the Lakes!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43680]), Text sample: "Did my young men take his scalp?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 187199]), Text sample: "His legs were good, though his arm is better for the hoe than the tomahawk," returned the other, pointing to the immovable form of Uncas.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 458639]), Text sample: Instead of manifesting any womanish curiosity to feast his eyes with the sight of a captive from a people he was known to have so much reason to hate, Magua continued to smoke, with the meditative air that he usually maintained, when there was no immediate call on his cunning or his eloquence.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 253920]), Text sample: Near a minute these two bold and untamed spirits stood regarding one another steadily in the eye, neither quailing in the least before the fierce gaze he encountered.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 192720]), Text sample: The hated and yet respected name was repeated as by one voice, carrying the sound even beyond the limits of the lodge.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 215041]), Text sample: The women and children, who lingered around the entrance, took up the words in an echo, which was succeeded by another shrill and plaintive howl.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 377762]), Text sample: Magua caught the expression, and raising his arm, he shook it at the captive, the light silver ornaments attached to his bracelet rattling with the trembling agitation of the limb, as, in a tone of vengeance, he exclaimed, in English:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 155759]), Text sample: Many of the Hurons understood the strange tongue in which the captive spoke, among which number was Magua.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 112560]), Text sample: This cunning savage beheld, and instantly profited by his advantage.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 305520]), Text sample: However much his influence among his people had been impaired by his occasional and besetting weakness, as well as by his desertion of the tribe, his courage and his fame as an orator were undeniable.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 211200]), Text sample: He again recounted the events of the attack on the island at Glenn's, the death of his associates and the escape of their most formidable enemies.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 192480]), Text sample: Each dusky figure seemed a breathing statue, so motionless was the posture, so intense the attention of the individual.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147120]), Text sample: One had never been known to follow the chase in vain; another had been indefatigable on the trail of their enemies.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 61922]), Text sample: This was brave, that generous.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 27120]), Text sample: You know they are not.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 165361]), Text sample: Their spirits are gone toward the setting sun, and are already crossing the great waters, to the happy hunting grounds.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 175922]), Text sample: But they departed without food, without guns or knives, without moccasins, naked and poor as they were born.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 280799]), Text sample: Shall this be? Are their souls to enter the land of the just like hungry Iroquois or unmanly Delawares, or shall they meet their friends with arms in their hands and robes on their backs?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 306000]), Text sample: They will look on their children with a dark eye, and say, 'Go! a Chippewa has come hither with the name of a Huron.' Brothers, we must not forget the dead; a red skin never ceases to remember.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 158880]), Text sample: We will load the back of this Mohican until he staggers under our bounty, and dispatch him after my young men.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 36240]), Text sample: Let this Delaware die."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74160]), Text sample: The quick and ready motion of the chief was not entirely too late.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 484320]), Text sample: Like their neighbors, they had followed Montcalm into the territories of the English crown, and were making heavy and serious inroads on the hunting grounds of the Mohawks; though they had seen fit, with the mysterious reserve so common among the natives, to withhold their assistance at the moment when it was most required.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 278160]), Text sample: As for the tribe itself, it had been content to announce to Montcalm, through his emissaries, with Indian brevity, that their hatchets were dull, and time was necessary to sharpen them.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 247920]), Text sample: The politic captain of the Canadas had deemed it wiser to submit to entertain a passive friend, than by any acts of ill judged severity to convert him into an open enemy.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147840]), Text sample: The chief extended his arm and taking the other by the wrist, they once more exchanged friendly salutations.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 273360]), Text sample: During the short and frugal repast that followed, the conversation was extremely circumspect, and related entirely to the events of the hunt, in which Magua had so lately been engaged.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 440880]), Text sample: It would have been impossible for the most finished breeding to wear more of the appearance of considering the visit as a thing of course, than did his hosts, notwithstanding every individual present was perfectly aware that it must be connected with some secret object and that probably of importance to themselves.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 160320]), Text sample: "Is the face of my great Canada father turned again toward his Huron children?" demanded the orator of the Delawares.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 161760]), Text sample: "It is so; but they are now bright and dull; for the Yengeese are dead, and the Delawares are our neighbors."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 119760]), Text sample: The other acknowledged the pacific compliment by a gesture of the hand, and remained silent.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 160320]), Text sample: Then Magua, as if recalled to such a recollection, by the allusion to the massacre, demanded:

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24000]), Text sample: "She is welcome."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 107520]), Text sample: "She is welcome," returned the chief of the latter nation, still more emphatically.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 247680]), Text sample: The baffled Magua continued silent several minutes, apparently indifferent, however, to the repulse he had received in this his opening effort to regain possession of Cora.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53760]), Text sample: Justice is the master of a red skin.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 217681]), Text sample: Why should they brighten their tomahawks and sharpen their knives against each other? Are not the pale faces thicker than the swallows in the season of flowers?"

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 166080]), Text sample: Magua waited a little, to permit his words to soften the feelings of the Delawares, before he added:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65759]), Text sample: Have not my brothers scented the feet of white men?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48479]), Text sample: "They will not find the Lenape asleep."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 165841]), Text sample: His nation would not go on the warpath, because they did not think it well, but their friends have remembered where they lived."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 212880]), Text sample: When he had thus announced his liberal intention, the crafty chief arose, and gravely spread his presents before the dazzled eyes of his hosts.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 146400]), Text sample: They consisted principally of trinkets of little value, plundered from the slaughtered females of William Henry.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 131039]), Text sample: In the division of the baubles the cunning Huron discovered no less art than in their selection.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 351121]), Text sample: While he bestowed those of greater value on the two most distinguished warriors, one of whom was his host, he seasoned his offerings to their inferiors with such well timed and apposite compliments, as left them no ground of complaint.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 365519]), Text sample: In short, the whole ceremony contained such a happy blending of the profitable with the flattering, that it was not difficult for the donor immediately to read the effect of a generosity so aptly mingled with praise, in the eyes of those he addressed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 153360]), Text sample: This well judged and politic stroke on the part of Magua was not without instantaneous results.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 362400]), Text sample: The Delawares lost their gravity in a much more cordial expression; and the host, in particular, after contemplating his own liberal share of the spoil for some moments with peculiar gratification, repeated with strong emphasis, the words:
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45359]), Text sample: "My brother is a wise chief.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24721]), Text sample: He is welcome."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 95279]), Text sample: "The Hurons love their friends the Delawares," returned Magua.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 29039]), Text sample: "Why should they not?

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 61202]), Text sample: "There have been strange moccasins about my camp.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48000]), Text sample: They have been tracked into my lodges."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 22319]), Text sample: "It would not do.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 70800]), Text sample: Did not the Huron chief say he took women in the battle?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 178800]), Text sample: Then they fled to the Delawares-for, say they, the Delawares are our friends; their minds are turned from their Canada father!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 341280]), Text sample: The recent defection of the tribe had, as they well knew themselves, subjected the Delawares to much reproach among their French allies; and they were now made to feel that their future actions were to be regarded with jealousy and distrust.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 283199]), Text sample: Their distant villages, their hunting grounds and hundreds of their women and children, together with a material part of their physical force, were actually within the limits of the French territory.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 238081]), Text sample: Accordingly, this alarming annunciation was received, as Magua intended, with manifest disapprobation, if not with alarm.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 70801]), Text sample: When he is told a bloody Yengee smokes at your fire?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 108241]), Text sample: "Where is the Yengee that the Delawares fear?" returned the other; "who has slain my young men?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 55200]), Text sample: Who is the mortal enemy of my Great Father?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 227519]), Text sample: "A Huron never lies!" returned Magua, coldly, leaning his head against the side of the lodge, and drawing his slight robe across his tawny breast.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 141840]), Text sample: "Let the Delawares count their prisoners; they will find one whose skin is neither red nor pale."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48479]), Text sample: A long and musing pause succeeded.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 182642]), Text sample: The chief consulted apart with his companions, and messengers despatched to collect certain others of the most distinguished men of the tribe.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 122401]), Text sample: The news spread from mouth to mouth, until the whole encampment became powerfully agitated.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 164161]), Text sample: The women suspended their labors, to catch such syllables as unguardedly fell from the lips of the consulting warriors.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 343919]), Text sample: When the excitement had a little abated, the old men disposed themselves seriously to consider that which it became the honor and safety of their tribe to perform, under circumstances of so much delicacy and embarrassment.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 211919]), Text sample: He, therefore, left the lodge and walked silently forth to the place, in front of the encampment, whither the warriors were already beginning to collect.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 146162]), Text sample: It might have been half an hour before each individual, including even the women and children, was in his place.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72961]), Text sample: Its number somewhat exceeded a thousand souls.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 265919]), Text sample: Until such a one chose to make some movement, no deeds in arms, no natural gifts, nor any renown as an orator, would have justified the slightest interruption.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 259202]), Text sample: The delay had already continued long beyond the usual deliberative pause that always preceded a conference; but no sign of impatience or surprise escaped even the youngest boy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 346561]), Text sample: They were all aged, even beyond that period to which the oldest present had reached; but one in the center, who leaned on his companions for support, had numbered an amount of years to which the human race is seldom permitted to attain.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 362640]), Text sample: His dark, wrinkled countenance was in singular and wild contrast with the long white locks which floated on his shoulders, in such thickness, as to announce that generations had probably passed away since they had last been shorn.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 381121]), Text sample: The dress of this patriarch-for such, considering his vast age, in conjunction with his affinity and influence with his people, he might very properly be termed-was rich and imposing, though strictly after the simple fashions of the tribe.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 580561]), Text sample: His head, on the whole of which the hair had been permitted to grow, the pursuits of war having so long been abandoned, was encircled by a sort of plated diadem, which, in its turn, bore lesser and more glittering ornaments, that sparkled amid the glossy hues of three drooping ostrich feathers, dyed a deep black, in touching contrast to the color of his snow white locks.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 193919]), Text sample: The eyes of the old man were closed, as though the organs were wearied with having so long witnessed the selfish workings of the human passions.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 253682]), Text sample: After a suitable and decent pause, the principal chiefs arose, and, approaching the patriarch, they placed his hands reverently on their heads, seeming to entreat a blessing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 184802]), Text sample: In a few minutes they reappeared, escorting the individuals who had caused all these solemn preparations toward the seat of judgment.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 446160]), Text sample: Riverboro was doing its best to return the entire tribe of Simpsons to the land of its fathers, so to speak, thinking rightly that the town which had given them birth, rather than the town of their adoption, should feed them and keep a roof over their heads until the children were of an age for self support.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 178320]), Text sample: They were not exactly popular favorites, but they did receive certain undesirable morsels from the more charitable housewives.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 553440]), Text sample: Life was rather dull and dreary, however, and in the chill and gloom of November weather, with the vision of other people's turkeys bursting with fat, and other people's golden pumpkins and squashes and corn being garnered into barns, the young Simpsons groped about for some inexpensive form of excitement, and settled upon the selling of soap for a premium.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 258720]), Text sample: They had sold enough to their immediate neighbors during the earlier autumn to secure a child's handcart, which, though very weak on its pins, could be trundled over the country roads.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 387120]), Text sample: With large business sagacity and an executive capacity which must have been inherited from their father, they now proposed to extend their operations to a larger area and distribute soap to contiguous villages, if these villages could be induced to buy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 291120]), Text sample: It was at this juncture that Clara Belle and Susan Simpson consulted Rebecca, who threw herself solidly and wholeheartedly into the enterprise, promising her help and that of Emma Jane Perkins.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 198720]), Text sample: The premiums within their possible grasp were three: a bookcase, a plush reclining chair, and a banquet lamp.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 432480]), Text sample: It looked to be about eight feet tall in the catalogue, and Emma Jane advised Clara Belle to measure the height of the Simpson ceilings; but a note in the margin of the circular informed them that it stood two and a half feet high when set up in all its dignity and splendor on a proper table, three dollars extra.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 530400]), Text sample: It was only of polished brass, continued the circular, though it was invariably mistaken for solid gold, and the shade that accompanied it (at least it accompanied it if the agent sold a hundred extra cakes) was of crinkled crepe paper printed in a dozen delicious hues, from which the joy dazzled agent might take his choice.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 537360]), Text sample: Clara Belle was rather a successful agent, but Susan, who could only say "thoap," never made large returns, and the twins, who were somewhat young to be thoroughly trustworthy, could be given only a half dozen cakes at a time, and were obliged to carry with them on their business trips a brief document stating the price per cake, dozen, and box.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 401520]), Text sample: Rebecca and Emma Jane offered to go two or three miles in some one direction and see what they could do in the way of stirring up a popular demand for the Snow White and Rose Red brands, the former being devoted to laundry purposes and the latter being intended for the toilet.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 269520]), Text sample: They had the soap company's circular from which to arrange a proper speech, and they had, what was still better, the remembrance of a certain patent medicine vender's discourse at the Milltown Fair.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 151920]), Text sample: His method, when once observed, could never be forgotten; nor his manner, nor his vocabulary.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 100800]), Text sample: Emma Jane practiced it on Rebecca, and Rebecca on Emma Jane.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 208320]), Text sample: It is called the Snow White and Rose Red Soap, six cakes in an ornamental box, only twenty cents for the white, twenty five cents for the red.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 156480]), Text sample: It is made from the purest ingredients, and if desired could be eaten by an invalid with relish and profit."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 151440]), Text sample: "Oh, Rebecca, don't let's say that!" interposed Emma Jane hysterically. "It makes me feel like a fool."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 346080]), Text sample: "It takes so little to make you feel like a fool, Emma Jane," rebuked Rebecca, "that sometimes I think that you must BE one I don't get to feeling like a fool so awfully easy; now leave out that eating part if you don't like it, and go on."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 110640]), Text sample: "The Snow White is probably the most remarkable laundry soap ever manufactured.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 295920]), Text sample: Immerse the garments in a tub, lightly rubbing the more soiled portions with the soap; leave them submerged in water from sunset to sunrise, and then the youngest baby can wash them without the slightest effort."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 85200]), Text sample: "BABE, not baby," corrected Rebecca from the circular.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66480]), Text sample: "It's just the same thing," argued Emma Jane.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 195840]), Text sample: "Of course it's just the same THING; but a baby has got to be called babe or infant in a circular, the same as it is in poetry!

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 104160]), Text sample: "No," grumbled Emma Jane; "infant is worse even than babe.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 181440]), Text sample: Rebecca, do you think we'd better do as the circular says, and let Elijah or Elisha try the soap before we begin selling?"

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 146160]), Text sample: "No," answered Emma Jane after a long pause; "no, it don't; not a mite."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90000]), Text sample: "Perhaps dizzy isn't just the right word, but it's nearest.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74400]), Text sample: If you could be a tree, which one would you choose?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 319680]), Text sample: Emma Jane had enjoyed considerable experience of this kind, and Rebecca had succeeded in unstopping her ears, ungluing her eyes, and loosening her tongue, so that she could "play the game" after a fashion.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 22560]), Text sample: Rebecca laughed.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 88319]), Text sample: "Then I could see so much more than your pink apple tree by the pig pen.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 396240]), Text sample: They did not accompany each other to the doors of their chosen victims, feeling sure that together they could not approach the subject seriously; but they parted at the gate of each house, the one holding the horse while the other took the soap samples and interviewed any one who seemed of a coming on disposition.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 399840]), Text sample: Emma Jane had disposed of three single cakes, Rebecca of three small boxes; for a difference in their ability to persuade the public was clearly defined at the start, though neither of them ascribed either success or defeat to anything but the imperious force of circumstances.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 188640]), Text sample: Housewives looked at Emma Jane and desired no soap; listened to her description of its merits, and still desired none.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 71280]), Text sample: Other stars in their courses governed Rebecca's doings.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 445200]), Text sample: The people whom she interviewed either remembered their present need of soap, or reminded themselves that they would need it in the future; the notable point in the case being that lucky Rebecca accomplished, with almost no effort, results that poor little Emma Jane failed to attain by hard and conscientious labor.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 228000]), Text sample: "It's your turn, Rebecca, and I'm glad, too," said Emma Jane, drawing up to a gateway and indicating a house that was set a considerable distance from the road.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 382560]), Text sample: "I haven't got over trembling from the last place yet." (A lady had put her head out of an upstairs window and called, "Go away, little girl; whatever you have in your box we don't want any.") "I don't know who lives here, and the blinds are all shut in front.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 112800]), Text sample: If there's nobody at home you mustn't count it, but take the next house as yours."

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 180480]), Text sample: There was a porch there, and seated in a rocking chair, husking corn, was a good looking young man, or was he middle aged?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 241200]), Text sample: Rebecca could not make up her mind. At all events he had an air of the city about him,--well shaven face, well trimmed mustache, well fitting clothes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 227760]), Text sample: Rebecca was a trifle shy at this unexpected encounter, but there was nothing to be done but explain her presence, so she asked, "Is the lady of the house at home?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 102000]), Text sample: "I am the lady of the house at present," said the stranger, with a whimsical smile.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 30960]), Text sample: "What can I do for you?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 155760]), Text sample: "Have you ever heard of the-would you like, or I mean-do you need any soap?" queried Rebecca.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 76800]), Text sample: "Do I look as if I did?" he responded unexpectedly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 28800]), Text sample: Rebecca dimpled.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 219120]), Text sample: "I didn't mean THAT; I have some soap to sell; I mean I would like to introduce to you a very remarkable soap, the best now on the market.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63840]), Text sample: "Made out of pure vegetable fats, isn't it?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58800]), Text sample: "The very purest," corroborated Rebecca.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 31440]), Text sample: "No acid in it?"

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 98400]), Text sample: "And yet a child could do the Monday washing with it and use no force."

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35040]), Text sample: "Oh! a babe, eh?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 113760]), Text sample: That child grows younger every year, instead of older-wise child!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 128640]), Text sample: This was great good fortune, to find a customer who knew all the virtues of the article in advance.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 172560]), Text sample: Rebecca dimpled more and more, and at her new friend's invitation sat down on a stool at his side near the edge of the porch.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 166320]), Text sample: Presently she forgot all about her silent partner at the gate and was talking as if she had known this grand personage all her life.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 102480]), Text sample: "I'm keeping house to day, but I don't live here," explained the delightful gentleman.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37200]), Text sample: "What was your worst trouble?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56880]), Text sample: "Lack of food and clothes principally."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 153360]), Text sample: "Oh!" exclaimed Rebecca sympathetically,--"mine was no shoes and too many babies and not enough books.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 92400]), Text sample: "I'm doing pretty well, thank you," said the man, with a delightful smile.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 83760]), Text sample: "Oh, I don't know about that; soap keeps, doesn't it?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 201840]), Text sample: "I'm not certain," said Rebecca conscientiously, "but I'll look in the circular-it's sure to tell;" and she drew the document from her pocket.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 92400]), Text sample: "What are you going to do with the magnificent profits you get from this business?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 264000]), Text sample: "We are not selling for our own benefit," said Rebecca confidentially. "My friend who is holding the horse at the gate is the daughter of a very rich blacksmith, and doesn't need any money.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67440]), Text sample: We are trying to get a premium for some friends of ours."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 142080]), Text sample: "You needn't argue that point," laughed the man, as he stood up to get a glimpse of the "rich blacksmith's daughter" at the gate.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 332640]), Text sample: "If they sell two hundred more cakes this month and next, they can have the lamp by Christmas," Rebecca answered, "and they can get a shade by summer time; but I'm afraid I can't help very much after to day, because my aunt Miranda may not like to have me."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 28560]), Text sample: "I see.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37680]), Text sample: Well, that's all right.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78480]), Text sample: I'll take three hundred cakes, and that will give them shade and all."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 241680]), Text sample: Rebecca had been seated on a stool very near to the edge of the porch, and at this remark she made a sudden movement, tipped over, and disappeared into a clump of lilac bushes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 165840]), Text sample: It was a very short distance, fortunately, and the amused capitalist picked her up, set her on her feet, and brushed her off.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 264000]), Text sample: "You should never seem surprised when you have taken a large order," said he; "you ought to have replied 'Can't you make it three hundred and fifty?' instead of capsizing in that unbusinesslike way."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 139200]), Text sample: "Oh, I could never say anything like that!" exclaimed Rebecca, who was blushing crimson at her awkward fall.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41760]), Text sample: Are you sure you can afford it?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 103200]), Text sample: "If I can't, I'll save on something else," returned the jocose philanthropist.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 91440]), Text sample: "What if your aunt shouldn't like the kind of soap?" queried Rebecca nervously.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53280]), Text sample: "Mine doesn't!" exclaimed Rebecca
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45120]), Text sample: "Then there's something wrong with your aunt!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46800]), Text sample: "Or with me," laughed Rebecca.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53760]), Text sample: "Rebecca Rowena Randall, sir."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 51120]), Text sample: "What?" with an amused smile.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42960]), Text sample: Your mother was generous."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 88320]), Text sample: "I think I know already," answered Rebecca, with a bright glance.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 83040]), Text sample: She must be so tired waiting, and she will be so glad!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 48480]), Text sample: Emma Jane! we are sold out!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 332880]), Text sample: mr Aladdin followed smilingly to corroborate this astonishing, unbelievable statement; lifted all their boxes from the back of the wagon, and taking the circular, promised to write to the Excelsior Company that night concerning the premium.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 332880]), Text sample: "If you could contrive to keep a secret,--you two little girls,--it would be rather a nice surprise to have the lamp arrive at the Simpsons' on Thanksgiving Day, wouldn't it?" he asked, as he tucked the old lap robe cosily over their feet.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 82080]), Text sample: "Oh, don't mention it!" laughed mr Aladdin, lifting his hat.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147120]), Text sample: "I was a sort of commercial traveler myself once,--years ago,--and I like to see the thing well done.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45121]), Text sample: Good by Miss Rebecca Rowena!

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 136560]), Text sample: "He tucked the lap robe round us, too," continued Emma Jane, in an ecstasy of reminiscence.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63121]), Text sample: "Oh! isn't he perfectly elergant?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60720]), Text sample: And wasn't it lovely of him to buy us out?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 96479]), Text sample: And just think of having both the lamp and the shade for one day's work!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 133680]), Text sample: Aren't you glad you wore your pink gingham now, even if mother did make you put on flannel underneath?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 124560]), Text sample: You do look so pretty in pink and red, Rebecca, and so homely in drab and brown!"

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 210719]), Text sample: You wouldn't believe it, but I was a dreadful homely baby, and homely right along till just a year or two ago, when my red hair began to grow dark.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74160]), Text sample: "I never thought to ask!" ejaculated Rebecca.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 77280]), Text sample: But I called him mr Aladdin because he gave us a lamp.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 122640]), Text sample: "Oh, Rebecca! how could you call him a nickname the very first time you ever saw him?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 127681]), Text sample: "Aladdin isn't a nickname exactly; anyway, he laughed and seemed to like it."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 380880]), Text sample: By dint of superhuman effort, and putting such a seal upon their lips as never mortals put before, the two girls succeeded in keeping their wonderful news to themselves; although it was obvious to all beholders that they were in an extraordinary and abnormal state of mind.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 343199]), Text sample: Rebecca had heard the news of its arrival, but waited until nearly dark before asking permission to go to the Simpsons', so that she might see the gorgeous trophy lighted and sending a blaze of crimson glory through its red crepe paper shade.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 203760]), Text sample: THE RIVER!' just like that-the same as Eliza did in the play; then I leaped from puddle to puddle, and Living and Emma Jane pursued me like the bloodhounds.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 111840]), Text sample: And Eliza wasn't swearing when she said 'My God! the river!' It was more like praying."

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46320]), Text sample: "She doesn't look the least bit like him."

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 159360]), Text sample: Altogether she looked more as if she might be a big member of the Sparrow family than the wife of handsome Rosebreast.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 138000]), Text sample: While Rosebreast sang, mrs Grosbeak was very busily picking buds and blossoms from the tree.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72480]), Text sample: "What is she doing that for?" inquired peter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 142800]), Text sample: "For the same reason that you bite off sweet clover blossoms and leaves," replied Jenny Wren tartly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 153840]), Text sample: "Do you mean to say that they live on buds and blossoms?" cried peter. "I never heard of such a thing."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 109200]), Text sample: You can ask more silly questions than anybody of my acquaintance," retorted Jenny Wren.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 71280]), Text sample: "Of course they don't live on buds and blossoms.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 109440]), Text sample: If they did they would soon starve to death, for buds and blossoms don't last long.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 205200]), Text sample: You ask Farmer Brown's boy who helps him most in his potato patch, and he'll tell you it's the Grosbeaks. They certainly do love potato bugs.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 94800]), Text sample: At first peter had eyes only for the wonderful beauty of Redcoat.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 175440]), Text sample: Then quite suddenly it came over peter that something was wrong with Redcoat, and he hurried forward to see what the trouble might be.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 216720]), Text sample: Redcoat heard the rustle of Peter's feet among the dry leaves and at once began to flap and flutter in an effort to fly away, but he could not get off the ground.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 36480]), Text sample: It is just peter Rabbit.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67920]), Text sample: You don't have anything to fear from me," cried peter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 158160]), Text sample: The look of terror which had been in the eyes of Redcoat died out, and he stopped fluttering and simply lay panting.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 140400]), Text sample: "Oh, peter," he gasped, "you don't know how glad I am that it is only you.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 95280]), Text sample: I've had a terrible accident, and I don't know what I am to do.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 127680]), Text sample: I can't fly, and if I have to stay on the ground some enemy will be sure to get me.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 36240]), Text sample: What shall I do, peter?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52080]), Text sample: Right away peter was full of sympathy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 112080]), Text sample: "What kind of an accident was it, Redcoat, and how did it happen?" he asked.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 91200]), Text sample: "Broadwing the Hawk tried to catch me," sobbed Redcoat.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 146880]), Text sample: "In dodging him among the trees I was heedless for a moment and did not see just where I was going.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 126000]), Text sample: I struck a sharp pointed dead twig and drove it right through my right wing."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 177599]), Text sample: Redcoat held up his right wing and sure enough there was a little stick projecting from both sides close up to the shoulder.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 40320]), Text sample: The wing was bleeding a little.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 84480]), Text sample: "Oh, dear, whatever shall I do, peter Rabbit?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 71281]), Text sample: Whatever shall I do?" sobbed Redcoat.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63120]), Text sample: "Does it pain you dreadfully?" asked peter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24000]), Text sample: Redcoat nodded.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 80400]), Text sample: "But I don't mind the pain," he hastened to say.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 62640]), Text sample: "It is the thought of what MAY happen to me."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99120]), Text sample: She was dressed almost wholly in light olive green and greenish yellow.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 116160]), Text sample: She looked no more like beautiful Redcoat than did mrs Grosbeak like Rosebreast.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 122399]), Text sample: "Can't you fly up just a little way so as to get off the ground?" she cried anxiously.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 81600]), Text sample: "Isn't it dreadful, peter Rabbit, to have such an accident?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 137760]), Text sample: We've just got our nest half built, and I don't know what I shall do if anything happens to Redcoat.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 181920]), Text sample: Hide!" mrs Tanager flew off a short distance to one side and began to cry as if in the greatest distress.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 158879]), Text sample: Poor Redcoat, with the old look of terror in his eyes, fluttered along, trying to find something under which to hide.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 70320]), Text sample: "Don't be afraid, Redcoat," he whispered.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 252000]), Text sample: "It's Farmer Brown's boy and I'm sure he won't hurt you. Perhaps he can help you." Then peter scampered off for a short distance and sat up to watch what would happen.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 60721]), Text sample: Of coarse Farmer Brown's boy saw Redcoat.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 123118]), Text sample: No one with any eyes at all could have helped seeing him, because of that wonderful scarlet coat.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 162719]), Text sample: Farmer Brown's boy understood instantly that something was wrong with one wing, and running forward, he caught Redcoat.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 36000]), Text sample: "You poor little thing.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 213841]), Text sample: You poor, beautiful little creature," said Farmer Brown's boy softly as he saw the cruel twig sticking through Redcoats' shoulder.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 163440]), Text sample: "We'll have to get that out right away," continued Farmer Brown's boy, stroking Redcoat ever so gently.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 153840]), Text sample: Somehow at that gentle touch Redcoat lost much of his fear, and a little hope sprang in his heart.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 186719]), Text sample: Then, doing his best to be careful and to hurt as little as possible, he worked the other part of the twig out from the under side.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 86160]), Text sample: Carefully he examined the wing to see if any bones were broken.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 170401]), Text sample: None were, and after holding Redcoat a few minutes he carefully set him up in a tree and withdrew a short distance.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 97440]), Text sample: Redcoat hopped from branch to branch until he was halfway up the tree.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 300720]), Text sample: Then he sat there for some time as if fearful of trying that injured wing. Meanwhile mrs Tanager came and fussed about him and talked to him and coaxed him and made as much of him as if he were a baby.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 218160]), Text sample: "I knew Farmer Brown's boy would help him, and I'm so glad he found him," cried peter happily and started for the dear Old Briar patch.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 282000]), Text sample: Thenardier had just passed his fiftieth birthday; Madame Thenardier was approaching her forties, which is equivalent to fifty in a woman; so that there existed a balance of age between husband and wife.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 24960]), Text sample: She had a beard.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 125760]), Text sample: She swore splendidly; she boasted of being able to crack a nut with one blow of her fist.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 234480]), Text sample: His cunning began here; he smiled habitually, by way of precaution, and was almost polite to everybody, even to the beggar to whom he refused half a farthing.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 306480]), Text sample: He composed the travellers' tariff card in a superior manner, but practised eyes sometimes spied out orthographical errors in it. Thenardier was cunning, greedy, slothful, and clever.

Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 76800]), Text sample: Emil's ship is lost, and as yet no news of him.'
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 154560]), Text sample: Tidings had been sent to the shipowners at Hamburg by some of the survivors, and telegraphed at once by Franz to his uncle.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 161040]), Text sample: Mrs Jo refused to believe it, stoutly insisting that Emil would outlive any storm and yet turn up safe and gay.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 165600]), Text sample: Teddy stood on his head literally, and tore about the neighbourhood on Octoo, like a second Paul Revere-only his tidings were good.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 210960]), Text sample: There was great scrubbing and dusting among the matrons as they set their houses in order not only for Class Day, but to receive the bride and groom, who were to come to them for the honeymoon trip.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 106800]), Text sample: Yet his success was far greater than Nat's, though only God and one good man saw it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 268320]), Text sample: When he thought of it Dan felt as if he could not wait, but must burst that narrow cell and fly away, as the caddis worms he used to watch by the brookside shed their stony coffins, to climb the ferns and soar into the sky.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35041]), Text sample: I must get over this first.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 190800]), Text sample: A few days after Chebec and his wife started building their nest in the Old Orchard peter dropped around as usual for a very early call.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 266160]), Text sample: He found Chebec very busy hunting for materials for that nest, because, as he explained to peter, mrs Chebec is very particular indeed about what her nest is made of.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63120]), Text sample: But he had time to tell peter a bit of news.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 235440]), Text sample: "My fighting cousin and my handsomest cousin arrived together yesterday, and now our family is very well represented in the Old Orchard," said Chebec proudly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 182640]), Text sample: Slowly peter reached over his back with his long left hind foot and thoughtfully scratched his long right ear.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 99840]), Text sample: He didn't like to admit that he couldn't recall those two cousins of Chebec's.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 86400]), Text sample: "Did you say your fighting cousin?" he asked in a hesitating way.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 75120]), Text sample: "He is Scrapper the Kingbird, as of course you know.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 62640]), Text sample: The rest of us always feel safe when he is about."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 165120]), Text sample: Of course, peter couldn't be left out of anything like that, and he scampered for the scene of trouble as fast as his legs could take him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 96960]), Text sample: For a minute peter couldn't think what was the trouble with Redtail, and then he saw.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 146160]), Text sample: He was just a little smaller than Welcome Robin, and in comparison with him Redtail was a perfect giant.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 92160]), Text sample: But this seemed to make no difference to Scrapper, for that is who it was.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 81600]), Text sample: It is because of his fearlessness that he is called Kingbird.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 127680]), Text sample: But none, not even Bully the English Sparrow, was brave enough to join him in attacking big Redtail.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 305040]), Text sample: When he had succeeded in driving Redtail far enough from the Old Orchard to suit him, Scrapper flew back and perched on a dead branch of one of the trees, where he received the congratulations of all his feathered neighbors.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 228240]), Text sample: He took them quite modestly, assuring them that he had done nothing, nothing at all, but that he didn't intend to have any of the Hawk family around the Old Orchard while he lived there.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 71520]), Text sample: peter couldn't help but admire Scrapper for his courage.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 228240]), Text sample: While peter sat staring up at him Scrapper suddenly darted out into the air, and his bill snapped in quite the same way Chebec's did when he caught a fly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23760]), Text sample: It was a bee.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 62400]), Text sample: "Do you live on bees altogether?" asked peter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 90240]), Text sample: "Bless your heart, peter, no," replied Scrapper with a chuckle.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52800]), Text sample: "There wouldn't be any honey if I did.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35280]), Text sample: They do no work at all.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 85440]), Text sample: peter knew better than to waste any effort trying to see that fly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 108720]), Text sample: He knew that he couldn't have seen it had it been only one fourth that distance away.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72000]), Text sample: "Are you going to build in the Old Orchard this year?" asked peter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47760]), Text sample: "Of course I am," declared Scrapper.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 5520]), Text sample: "I-"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 212400]), Text sample: Blacky saw him coming and was wise enough to suddenly appear to have no interest whatever in the Old Orchard, turning away toward the Green Meadows instead.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 50880]), Text sample: peter didn't wait for Scrapper to return.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 97200]), Text sample: Just as he was leaving the far corner of the Old Orchard some one called him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 18480]), Text sample: "peter!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56880]), Text sample: Oh, peter Rabbit!" called the voice.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 201360]), Text sample: peter stopped abruptly, sat up very straight, looked this way, looked that way and looked the other way, every way but the right way.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 87360]), Text sample: "Look up over your head," cried the voice, rather a harsh voice.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67440]), Text sample: It was Cresty the Great Crested Flycatcher.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 166800]), Text sample: He was a wee bit bigger than Scrapper the Kingbird, yet not quite so big as Welcome Robin, and more slender.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 95520]), Text sample: His throat and breast were gray, shading into bright yellow underneath.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 92640]), Text sample: A pointed cap was all that was needed to make him quite distinguished looking.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 109680]), Text sample: He certainly was the handsomest as well as the largest of the Flycatcher family.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57360]), Text sample: "I just want to ask one little favor of you."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 101760]), Text sample: "What is it?" asked peter, who is always glad to do any one a favor.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 147600]), Text sample: "A cast off suit of clothes from any member of the Snake family," replied Cresty somewhat impatiently.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 35520]), Text sample: "Now don't forget, peter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 199680]), Text sample: I've got to go house hunting, but you'll find me there or hereabouts, if it happens that you find one of those cast off Snake suits."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 80160]), Text sample: Before peter could say another word Cresty had flown away.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 140400]), Text sample: peter hesitated, looking first towards the dear Old Briar patch and then towards Jenny Wren's house.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 165600]), Text sample: He just couldn't understand about those cast off suits of the Snake family, and he felt sure that Jenny Wren could tell him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 181920]), Text sample: Finally curiosity got the best of him, and back he scampered, lipperty lipperty lip, to the foot of the tree in which Jenny Wren had her home.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 29760]), Text sample: "Jenny!" called peter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 23520]), Text sample: "Jenny Wren!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 186720]), Text sample: Jenny Wren!" No one answered him. He could hear mr Wren singing in another tree, but he couldn't see him. "Jenny!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 94080]), Text sample: This time Jenny popped her head out, and her little eyes fairly snapped.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 102480]), Text sample: "Didn't I tell you the other day, peter Rabbit, that I'm not to be disturbed?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 25680]), Text sample: Didn't I, peter Rabbit?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 33600]), Text sample: Didn't I? Didn't I?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 96240]), Text sample: You certainly did, and I'm sorry to disturb you," replied peter meekly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46320]), Text sample: "Snake skins," replied peter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44399]), Text sample: Snake skins!" shrieked Jenny Wren.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 13200]), Text sample: Ugh!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53760]), Text sample: "You don't understand," cried peter hurriedly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 212159]), Text sample: "What I want to know is, why should Cresty the Flycatcher ask me to please let him know if I found any cast off suits of the Snake family?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 204480]), Text sample: He flew away before I could ask him why he wants them, and so I came to you, because I know you know everything, especially everything concerning your neighbors."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 102240]), Text sample: Jenny Wren looked as if she didn't know whether to feel flattered or provoked.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 20640]), Text sample: CHAPTER eight.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 156480]), Text sample: On his way he couldn't resist the temptation to run over to the Green Forest, which was just beyond the Old Orchard.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 97680]), Text sample: Hardly had he reached it when he heard a plaintive voice crying, "Pee wee!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56160]), Text sample: Pee wee!" peter chuckled happily.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 76320]), Text sample: "He usually is one of the last of the Flycatcher family to arrive.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 46080]), Text sample: I didn't expect to find him yet.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 58320]), Text sample: I wonder what has brought him up so early."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 160080]), Text sample: It ended just where it had started, on a dead twig of a tree in a shady, rather lonely part of the Green Forest.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 105360]), Text sample: Almost at once he began to call his name in a rather sad, plaintive tone, "Pee wee! Pee wee!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 15360]), Text sample: Pee wee!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 67200]), Text sample: But he wasn't sad, as peter well knew.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 62640]), Text sample: It was his way of expressing how happy he felt.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 111360]), Text sample: He was a little bigger than his cousin, Chebec, but looked very much like him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 96960]), Text sample: The upper half of his bill was black, but the lower half was light.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 22080]), Text sample: Pewee nodded.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 103200]), Text sample: "If you please," peter inquired politely, "why do folks call you Wood Pewee?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 32880]), Text sample: Pewee chuckled happily.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64800]), Text sample: It is so quiet and restful that I love it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56400]), Text sample: mrs Pewee and I are very retiring.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45600]), Text sample: "Come as often as you like," replied Pewee.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 469680]), Text sample: Back in the Old Briar patch peter thought over all he had learned about the Flycatcher family, and as he recalled how they were forever catching all sorts of flying insects it suddenly struck him that they must be very useful little people in helping Old Mother Nature take care of her trees and other growing things which insects so dearly love to destroy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 260880]), Text sample: But most of all peter thought about that queer request of Cresty's, and a dozen times that day he found himself peeping under old logs in the hope of finding a cast off coat of mr Black Snake.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 266160]), Text sample: It was such a funny thing for Cresty to ask for that Peter's curiosity would allow him no peace, and the next morning he was up in the Old Orchard before jolly mr Sun had kicked his bedclothes off.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 61440]), Text sample: Jenny couldn't keep her tongue still if she wanted to.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 84240]), Text sample: "Did you find any old clothes of the Snake family?" she demanded.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 49920]), Text sample: "Why they want it, goodness knows!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65040]), Text sample: Perhaps they think it will scare robbers away.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 13200]), Text sample: Ugh!"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 59280]), Text sample: "By the way, where does Cresty build?" asked peter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 55920]), Text sample: peter looked quite as surprised as he felt.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 45600]), Text sample: "Does Cresty make the hole?" he asked.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43200]), Text sample: "Where are your eyes, peter?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 168000]), Text sample: Did you ever see a Flycatcher with a bill that looked as if it could cut wood?" She didn't wait for a reply, but rattled on.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 12000]), Text sample: Look!
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 19920]), Text sample: That's good.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 31440]), Text sample: I like to see that.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 149760]), Text sample: But the Woodpeckers seem to like new houses best, which, as I said before, is a very good thing for the rest of us."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 37680]), Text sample: peter grinned and looked foolish.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 55200]), Text sample: "And Skimmer the Tree Swallow," added Jenny.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 34320]), Text sample: Again Jenny Wren nodded.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 165360]), Text sample: Yellow Wing the flicker, who really is a Woodpecker, often uses an old house, but quite often makes a new one.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 106800]), Text sample: Then there are Killy the Sparrow Hawk and Spooky the Screech Owl."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 30480]), Text sample: peter looked surprised.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 72240]), Text sample: "They certainly do, more's the pity!" snapped Jenny.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 114000]), Text sample: But they do, and an old house of Yellow Wing the Flicker suits either of them.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 47280]), Text sample: I've talked quite enough for one morning."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 64080]), Text sample: Jenny paused and jerked her tail impatiently.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 43920]), Text sample: "Have you got two homes?" asked peter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 55920]), Text sample: "What do you suppose I want of two homes?
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 44160]), Text sample: One is all I can take care of."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 65520]), Text sample: Jenny Wren's eyes twinkled, and she laughed softly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 113760]), Text sample: "mr Wren just has to be busy about something, bless his heart," said she.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 80400]), Text sample: He's building that nest to take up his time and keep out of mischief.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 136080]), Text sample: peter scratched a long ear with a long hind foot, trying to think of some place to go.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 42000]), Text sample: "That's where I'll go!" exclaimed peter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 121440]), Text sample: I'll just run over and pay my respects to Grandfather Frog, and to Redwing the Blackbird.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 102720]), Text sample: Redwing was one of the first birds to arrive, and I've neglected him shamefully."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 78240]), Text sample: When peter thinks of something to do he wastes no time.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 86640]), Text sample: Off he started, lipperty lipperty lip, for the Smiling Pool.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 254160]), Text sample: He kept close to the edge of the Green Forest until he reached the place where the Laughing Brook comes out of the Green Forest on its way to the Smiling Pool in the Green Meadows.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 105600]), Text sample: Bushes and young trees grow along the banks of the Laughing Brook at this point.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66240]), Text sample: The ground was soft in places, quite muddy.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 100560]), Text sample: peter doesn't mind getting his feet damp, so he hopped along carelessly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 112080]), Text sample: From right under his very nose something shot up into the air with a whistling sound.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 108240]), Text sample: It startled peter so that he stopped short with his eyes popping out of his head.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 129600]), Text sample: He had just a glimpse of a brown form disappearing over the tops of some tall bushes.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 29280]), Text sample: Then peter chuckled.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 38640]), Text sample: He scared me for a second."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 28080]), Text sample: "You scared him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 52320]), Text sample: I saw you coming, but Longbill didn't."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41280]), Text sample: peter turned quickly.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 101040]), Text sample: There was mrs Woodcock peeping at him from behind a tussock of grass.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 57360]), Text sample: "I didn't mean to scare him," apologized peter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 36000]), Text sample: "I really didn't mean to.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63360]), Text sample: Do you think he was really very much scared?"
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 127440]), Text sample: "Not too scared to come back, anyway," said Longbill himself, dropping down just in front of peter.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 158400]), Text sample: I am glad it is no one but you, peter, for I was having a splendid meal here, and I should have hated to leave it.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 66240]), Text sample: You'll excuse me while I go on eating, I hope.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 41040]), Text sample: We can talk between bites."
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 74880]), Text sample: But peter couldn't see a thing that looked good to eat.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 70560]), Text sample: There wasn't even a bug or a worm crawling on the ground.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 110160]), Text sample: Longbill took two or three steps in rather a stately fashion.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 63360]), Text sample: But his bill was long enough to make up.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 172560]), Text sample: His back was a mixture of gray, brown, black and buff, while his breast and under parts were a beautiful reddish buff.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 56640]), Text sample: It was his head that made him look queer.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 190080]), Text sample: His eyes were very big and they were set so far back that peter wondered if it wasn't easier for him to look behind him than in front of him.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 62880]), Text sample: Suddenly Longbill plunged his bill into the ground.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 53760]), Text sample: He plunged it in for the whole length.
Sample rate: 24000, Waveform shape: torch.Size([1, 135360]), Text sample: Then he pulled it out and peter caught a glimpse of the tail end of a worm disappearing down Longbill's throat.
